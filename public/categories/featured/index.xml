      <description>This is it. Tomorrow morning, I embark on my second trip to Japan. For the next week, I&amp;rsquo;ll explore Osaka, Kyoto and Nara. Compared to Tokyo, I expect similarities but a much different experience. Primarily, I will be open to experiment with unfamiliar foods. At the top of my list is takoyaki, which is a ball-shaped Japanese snack. It&amp;rsquo;s typically filled with octopus. There&amp;rsquo;s also kushikatsu, which is basically fried food on a skewer.</description>
