description: Jacob Proffer's time in Ikebukuro and Akihabara, Tokyo, Japan.
---

For the final full day in Tokyo, Japan, I wanted to go to Ikebukuro for the Pokemon Center and revisit Akihabara. Which meant that it was going to be a long day. But I still made time for breakfast at the Bonsalute Kabuki. I decided to mix it up this time and try some noodles and white rice. But I also had potatoes and sausages again with orange juice. Even though the food was delicious and it was a buffet, the restaurant was pricey at nearly three-thousand yen.

After breakfast, I walked over to Shinjuku Station and purchased a round-trip ticket for Ikebukuro. The ticket price was dirt cheap, under two-hundred yen. The ride still lasted a half-hour but the car was nearly empty as it arrived at an underground platform. The plus side was that the station in Ikebukuro was heated. It was a chilly day in Japan. I had to break out my windbreaker and gloves to stay warm.

But I had to exit the station eventually to get to Sunshine City, a shopping mall, which is where the Pokemon Center in Ikebukuro is located. The mall was a twenty minute walk from Ikebukuro Station, which took me through a wide range of side streets, alleys and even a highway. There weren't many people around, which made the city feel somewhat empty. I did, however, hangout with a large raven that was perched on a street sign for a few minutes.
