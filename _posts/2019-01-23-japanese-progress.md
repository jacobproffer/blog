Regarded as one of the most difficult languages to learn, I never thought I'd actually study Japanese. But as of today, the language has been part of my daily life for eight months. I thought it would be a hobby for a short time and then I'd get bored or too frustrated. As of now, I've learned hiragana (ひりがな), katakana (カタカナ) and a vast number of kanji (漢字) characters and vocabulary. I can carry basic conversations, write, type and even read a little. It's a constant process but I absolutely love the language. I just take it a day at a time.

Similar to web development, there are a variety of resources available to learn Japanese online. I originally started with [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) and gravitated towards a paid subscription to [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/). Both applications have pros and cons but I found Memrise to have more professional voice recordings. The negative aspect of both applications is that katakana and kanji are introduced prematurely. There needs to be more emphasis on kanji meanings if the characters are to be used.

To combat that issue, I started to learn kanji through another web application called [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/). The service teaches kanji and vocabulary through radicals and mnemonics.
