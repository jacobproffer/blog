description: Leaving Tokyo, Japan.
---

As much I hated to do so, I checked out of the Hotel Gracery on Monday morning around ten. The process only required the return of the room key. I considered breakfast at the Bonsalute Kabuki on the ground floor but decided to head to the Shinjuku Station instead. Although my flight wasn't until six in the evening, I wanted to have plenty of time for the train ride, security and customs. I also planned to have a few hours to walk around the airport before the thirteen hour flight.

But I wouldn't be able to leave Shinjuku for a few hours yet. At Shinjuku Station, I was told that the next Skyliner train to Narita wouldn't leave for nearly two hours. I still purchased a ticket and found my way to a set of stairs that lead up to the designated platform. Though as with Ikebukuro, I decided to remain below ground to stay out of the chilly air in the morning. The good news is that I made a friend throughout the wait. I met Vic, a traveler from Belgium.
