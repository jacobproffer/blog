description: The night before my trip to Iceland.
---

This is it. Tomorrow morning, I embark on a trip to Iceland with my best friend and co-worker, Myles Kedrowski. We should both touch down in Keflavik on Tuesday morning around the same time, though we will be on separate flights. Myles is fortunate to have a direct flight from Minnesota, via Iceland Air. I get to enjoy three separate Delta flights, which starts with a quick flight from K.I. Sawyer to Detroit. Fortunately for me, I love airports and flying.
