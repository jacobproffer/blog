6265 miles. That's how far I had to travel to get to Tokyo, Japan. Thankfully, I managed to due so in relative comfort aboard an American Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The flight, spanning 13 hours and 15 minutes, took place on a Tuesday afternoon out of Chicago O'hare International Airport.

I remember the approach to my designated gate, K5. The plane was about to reach the jet bridge as I took a seat. The engines alone told me that this was a larger aircraft than the CRJs in the area. After the 787 powered down, ground crew got to work and flight attendants boarded for prep work. I spent the remainder of the time people watching and going over my itinerary.

As boarding commenced, I was anxious. I was curious how I would fair on a long-haul flight. My longest flight duration up to that point was barely three hours.
