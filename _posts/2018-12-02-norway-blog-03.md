The ferry from Tørvikbygd to Jondal is a short but pleasant experience. With an average time of twenty minutes to cross, Myles and I had time to use the bathroom, take pictures and even grab food from the onboard deli. The trick is to be on the same schedule as the ferry, as it only crosses once per hour. We arrived early Sunday morning but had to wait a half hour to board. Although patient, Myles and I were concerned that the delay would cost us sunlight.

Our goal was to hike Åkrafjorden. The fjord is located over three hours to the south east of Bergen, so transit time was constantly monitored. We also had to budget in the four hour estimate to the reach the top of fjord with enough time to descend before nightfall. As well, with the recent experience of ice in Aurlandsdalen, we expected the same conditions or worse towards the top of the fjord. It was a constant worry of not having enough time.

The one plus for the day was that the sky was blue and the temperature was steady in the low fifties.
