The drive to Skaftafell, a wilderness area inside of Vatnajökull National Park, took over four hours. Myles and I got up early on Friday to make the day trip. After brunch at the hotel, we were on the road before seven. Past the main attractions in the south center of Iceland, it was a rare occasion to pass another vehicle on Route 1. Throughout the scenic two hundred mile drive, we had near constant views of distant mountains, waterfalls and cliffs.

We arrived at Skaftafell at eleven thirty in the morning. The service charge was 750 Icelandic Króna for parking, which is less than seven dollars. Payment was made inside of the visitor centre, which came complete with a free park booklet. Myles and I also bought detailed maps of the area and decided that Svartifoss would be our first location. From the visitor centre, the waterfall is a mile hike uphill.

In the ascent, snow mixed with rain pelted our bodies.
