It was dark when the train pulled out of Narita. I did not expect this. In my mind, I had hopes to make it to Shinjuku and locate my hotel before nightfall. But apparently it gets dark in Japan earlier than back home. It was only six in the evening but it felt much later.

For the next hour, the train snaked through small towns and past open fields. I followed the progress of the train on my phone through Google Maps. We eventually pulled into Nippori Station. This is where I had to make the switch from the Skyliner to the JR Line. The issue was that I had no idea how to get to the correct platform. I exited the train quickly and tried to figure out where I had to go. There was an escalator to my left that went upstairs and the end of the platform to my front. But there were no signs. I approached an older man and asked in Japanese if he spoke in English. He shook his head and waved me on. I approached a younger man behind him and pointed at my phone on which I had brought up a map of Shinjuku. Without a word, he pointed up towards the escalator. I thanked him and for the first time, I bowed.
