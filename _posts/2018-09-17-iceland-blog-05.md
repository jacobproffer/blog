Saturday in Iceland was a day that lessons were taught. First and foremost, I learned that to bring denim to a wet environment is a mistake. It started with a hike up to a waterfall called Glymur. Myles and I started the hike around ten in the morning. From the time of our arrival, the rain had been consistent for hours. Yet we decides to go anyway by foot. Within a few minutes, my jeans were already soaked through. Only my jacket was waterproof.

To make matters worse, there was a river crossing along the path to the waterfall. The rocks were small and far apart from one side to the other. The smart idea would have been to take my socks and boots off. I tried without doing so, which ended with my boots and socks soaked through and through. Thankfully, there was a cave to take refuge in half way to the waterfall. But although the cave offered protection from the wind and rain, it did nothing to stop the cold.

With the addition of light snow, the rain worsened. Myles and I eventually pushed on to the waterfall after twenty minutes in the cave. A few other tourists made the ascent with us, with appropriate gear for the weather. Glymur, which is the second-highest waterfall in Iceland, is absolutely beautiful. The total height is 650 feet, with fresh water served from the Botns√° river and Hvalvatn lake. We spent a few minutes in an attempt to take photographs and then turned around for the descent.
