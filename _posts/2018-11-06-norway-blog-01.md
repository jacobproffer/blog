I touched down in Norway with a sunny view of distant fjords, islands and a fleet of helicopters. It was nine in the morning, four hours before Myles was due to fly in. Since I didn't have any luggage to claim, I bought a cup of coffee and relaxed in the main lounge. The Bergen airport is small in size, which left little to explore. But the nearby gates seemed to be busy. There were a range of flights going in and out for the first few hours and then it got real quiet.

Myles arrived shortly before two in the afternoon, with a range of other passengers from Amsterdam. Him and I proceeded to customs, only to find it vacant. We slowly walked through, with the expectation that we'd eventually see an employee. But then we emerged into the main lobby of the airport. No one questioned us and we never had to show our passports. To this day, I'm still not entirely sure why. The employee for Sixt car rental told us it wasn't necessary.

The drive to the First Hotel Marin was long and tedious. Traffic was backed up and moved at a slow pace. But eventually, Myles drove us into downtown Bergen. Only, he ended up in the wrong lane at one point, which sent us on an extended tour of the city. Similar to Iceland, vehicles were parked haphazardly. Some cars and vans were even parked halfway onto sidewalks. Myles parked the rental vehicle underneath the hotel, with a cost of twenty-five dollars a day.
