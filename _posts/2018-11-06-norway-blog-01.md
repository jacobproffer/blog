Norway started with a flight to Detroit out of Sawyer International Airport. After a four hour layover, I took an eight hour hull to Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. The flight was fantastic. I spent the majority of the time watching movies, such as Thelma &amp; Louise, with plenty of complementary drinks and food. Upon arrival, I went through customs and received a passport stamp. It was a surprise to me, as I had never flown to a foreign country for the sole purpose of a connecting flight.
