description: Jacob Proffer's time in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan.

Saturday in Tokyo was unique. I slept in for once, which provided an opportunity to seek breakfast somewhere other than Burger King. I tried out the breakfast buffet at the Bonsalute KABUKI, which was located on the ground floor of the hotel. Typically, the restaurant served Italian food throughout the day. But in the morning, there was a choice of delicious Western or Japanese breakfast foods. I enjoyed a meal of breakfast potatoes, sausages and croissants with second helpings. The staff spoke little English but it was most certainly not an issue.

The destination for the day was Shibuya, one of the special wards that make up Tokyo. Unlike Akihabara in the Chiyoda ward, Shibuya is a major commercial and business centre and closer to Shinjuku. It was only a twenty minute ride on the JR Line. Similar to Akihabara, I was early. Most stores wouldn't open for a few more hours. But I had a purpose with my early arrival. I wanted to watch the Shibuya Crossing, an infamous intersection. At peak times, hundreds of people cross at one time from all directions. And I had learned from YouTuber's [Kara and Nate](https://youtu.be/PMEZGx985Z8?t=5m40s) the perfect place to observe it, Starbucks.
