There were still plenty of sites to see in Iceland, far too many. Thursday was dedicated locations that Myles and I wanted to see towards the north east of Reykjavik. We got up around seven and were on the road again by eight. Though unlike Wednesday, we would not spend much time on Route 1 but a road called Road 36. The road is the main route from Reykjavik to Þingvellir, which was the first stop on our itinerary for the day.

From the start of the day, Myles and I made a mistake. We forgot to get gas for the vehicle before leaving the capital and the SUV was around a quarter full. Once out of Reykjavik, onto Road 36 and beyond, gas stations are far in between. We only realized that once we were over half way to Þingvellir, which is about twenty-seven miles away. I questioned whether we'd have enough gas to make it back to Reykjavik by the time we pulled into the parking lot for Þingvellir.

Myles and I stopped for food at Restaurant Lindin in Laugarvatn on our way to Geysir. Down the road is the Laugarvatn Fontana, one of the thermal spas in Iceland with outdoor mineral pools. The restaurant is located between Þingvellir and Gullfoss, well within the Golden Circle. The staff were extremely friendly, spoke English and offered us seats immediately. For lunch, I ordered a cheeseburger with frites. Myles had the reindeer burger, which is well known in Iceland.
