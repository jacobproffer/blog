bio: I'm Jacob. I'm a Front-End Developer at <a href="https://www.elegantseagulls.com/" class="link-hover" target='_blank'>Elegant Seagulls</a> in Marquette, Michigan. With a keen eye for detail and a passion for quality assurance, I deliver websites that adapt to all modern screen sizes and browsers. You can view some of my current and past open source projects on. I travel in my free time when I can. Within the past year, I've been to Tokyo, Japan, Iceland and Norway. With plans to one day return to Japan, I'm studying Japanese.
