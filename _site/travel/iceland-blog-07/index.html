The drive to the airport, which is in Keflavik, took around forty minutes from the capital. Once at the Keflavik Airport, I refueled the car at a nearby gas station and returned it to the designated parking lot for Europcar. An employee then inspected the vehicle while I signed paperwork. Afterwards, the same man drove Myles and I to the entrance of the airport.</p> <p>Myles flight wasn’t until the afternoon, so he waited in the lobby while I checked in. While inline for the ticket counter, Delta employees went from person to person to provide a basic security check. I was asked to provide my passport along with a series of questions. The questions included information about where I stayed, what the view from my hotel room was and how long I was in the country for. A green sticker was then placed on the back of my passport.</p> <p>The airport security process was standard. Boots were took off and placed in a standalone container. My bag and camera were placed in another. It was no different from any other airport that I’ve been to. The whole process took about two minutes. Myles came along as well, even though he had quite a few hours to wait. Unfortunately, due to length of time before Myles flight, he wasn’t allowed to go through customs with me. We had to say our goodbyes there.</p> <p>But it wouldn’t have mattered much if he was allowed to come. I had about ten minutes to visit the gift shop before my flight began the boarding process.</p> </div> </div> <div class="blog__pagination"> <div class="container container--small"> <a class="blog__pagination-item blog__pagination-item--prev" href="/travel/iceland-blog-06/">Prev Post</a> </div> </div> </section> </main> <footer class="footer"> <div class="container container-mid"> <ul class="footer__list"> <li class="footer__list-item"><a href="https://twitter.com/jacobproffer" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li> <li class="footer__list-item"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jacobproffer_/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li> </ul> </div> </footer> <script src="http://localhost:4000/dist/js/app.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> </body> </html>
