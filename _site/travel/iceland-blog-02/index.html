It started with breakfast at the hotel at around seven thirty, with the goal to leave the hotel by eight. For the half-hour breakfast, I enjoyed three waffles, sausages and baked beans. The coffee was great with no sugar and the orange juice just sweet enough. There also was a wide range of pastry offered, including croissants. But I refrained from overeating, as Myles and I had a lot of ground to cover that day.</p> <p>As planned, we left the hotel by eight. Our first stop for the day was Seljalandsfoss, a waterfall located in the southern region of Iceland. From Reykjavik, the drive to Seljalandsfoss took roughly an hour and a half along Route 1. The weather, as typical in Iceland, was unpredictable. Sometimes it rained, sometimes the rain stopped for a half hour. As Myles pulled into the parking lot for Seljalandsfoss, it began to rain with a slight wind.</p> <p>Near the middle of the lot is an automated payment booth for parking. There didn’t seem to be any apparent enforcement for paying. But Myles made a payment and received a paper ticket. From there, we went on foot towards the base of the waterfall. Once close, the mist along with the rain coated my belongings, along with my camera bag. So it was a mad dash to get underneath the waterfall. The entire time I felt I was on the verge of slipping on a rock.</p> <p>Myles and I spent about a half hour at Seljalandsfoss before we moved onto the next location. Hot chocolate and coffee was considered but I didn’t want to spend króna until lunch time. Though it was tempting, as the wind and rain chilled me to the bone. The mistake I made was to not wear my Under Armour thermals. We got back into the car to warm up and drove along Route 1 towards Skógafoss, another waterfall. The drive was only twenty-six minutes to the east.</p> <hr /> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/dist/img/near_seljalandsfoss.jpg" alt="Near Seljalandsfoss" /> <img src="http://localhost:4000/dist/img/seljalandsfoss.jpg" alt="Seljalandsfoss" /></p> <hr /> <!--- Skógafoss --> <!--- Lunch at Fossbud restaurant --> <!--- Solheimafjara (Plane crash) --> <!--- Dyrhólaey (Peninsula/Lighthouse) --> <!--- Cave --> <!--- Go to Reynisfjara (Black beach) --> <!--- Dinner at Black Beach restaurant --> <!--- Return to hotel --> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="prev pagination-item" href="/education/hiragana-progress/">Hiragana Progress</a> </div> </div> </section> </main> <footer class="footer"> <div class="container container-mid"> <ul class="social-links"> <li class="social-link"><a href="https://twitter.com/jacobproffer" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li> <li class="social-link"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jacobproffer_/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li> </ul> </div> </footer> <script src="http://localhost:4000/dist/js/app.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> </body> </html>
