Which meant that it was going to be a long day. But I still made time for breakfast at the Bonsalute Kabuki. I decided to mix it up this time and try some noodles and white rice. But I also had potatoes and sausages with orange juice. Even though the food was delicious and it was a buffet, the restaurant was pricey at nearly three-thousand yen.</p> <p>After breakfast, I walked over to Shinjuku Station and purchased a ticket that would take me from Shinjuku to Ikebukuro to Akihabara and then back to Shinjuku. I paid under five-hundred yen, which was cheap. The ride still lasted a half-hour to Ikebukuro but the car was nearly empty as it arrived at the station. The plus side was that the station was heated. It was a chilly day in Japan. I had to break out my windbreaker and gloves to stay warm.</p> <p>But I had to exit the station eventually to get to Sunshine City, a shopping mall, which is where the Pokémon Center in Ikebukuro is located. The mall was a twenty minute walk from Ikebukuro Station, which took me through a wide range of side streets, alleys and even a highway. There weren’t many people around, which made the city feel somewhat empty. I did, however, observe a large raven that was perched on a street sign for a few minutes.</p> <hr /> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/dist/img/ikebukuro_city.jpg" alt="The City of Ikebukuro" /></p> <hr /> <p>Once at Sunshine City, I went to use the one ATM machine in the mall to take out more yen. Unfortunately, the machine did not accept Visa cards. Which meant I had to scramble to find a 7-Eleven before the stores opened. Google Maps reported the nearest location to be back near Ikebukuro Station, which would have been a long walk. Oddly, I found an unmarked 7-Eleven nearby within five minutes. I took out ten-thousand yen and purchased a coffee with some change I had left over.</p> <p>The walk back took me across a multi-lane highway, which was almost bare. A lone taxi and city bus waited at the stoplight. Even though I had plenty of time, I still crossed in a hurry. The Pokémon Center wouldn’t open for another hour but I wanted to be early. And I discovered that I wasn’t the only one with that idea. There were people, mostly elders, asleep in the various lobbies around the mall. The lights were dimmed, which made it easy to take a quick nap myself.</p> <hr /> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/dist/img/ikebukuro_street.jpg" alt="Street in Ikebukuro" /></p> <hr /> <p>The Pokémon Center opened to a dense crowd. In ten minutes, parts of the store were nearly shoulder to shoulder. But the floor layout was open, which made it easy to browse the various shelves. Although it’d been eighteen years since I’d played Pokémon, it was great to see the mass amount of Pikachu merchandise. There were stuffed toys and Poké Balls but also Pikachu luggage covers. One item I came back to was a pair of chopsticks, which had Pikachu and Pichu printed on each stick.</p> <p>After I made my purchase, I left Sunshine City. There were other stores throughout the mall but I wanted to spend as much time back in Akihabara as I could. As amongst the few wards I’d explored throughout Tokyo, Akihabara was by far my favorite ward. It has a rich and vibrate culture that suited me well. Plus, there were still an abundance of stores and shops to visit. I also was on the hunt for more Alien merchandise, particularly a small figurine to take home.</p> <p>The train ride from Ikebukuro Station to Akihabara Station took around forty minutes, which allowed for me to arrive after noon. Since all stores were open by then, I didn’t have to wait to shop around. But I explored the various alleys for a bit to see the signage around the Electric Town portion of Akihabara. The advertisements and posters are bright, bold and colorful. Most signs are just text based, with colors that range from red, yellow, blue and green.</p> <hr /> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/dist/img/akihabara_alley.jpg" alt="Alley in Akihabara" /></p> <hr /> <p>Around one, I started to wonder through various department stores near the exit of Akihabara Station. The first store I entered, which spanned an entire floor, had an immense amount of model kits. There were Gundams, Zoids and a good amount of military models. One of the completed models on display was a Grumman F-14 Tomcat, with an extreme amount of detail. It was fully painted and weathered, with skulls on the tail fins. It was truly impressive.</p> <p>On the next floor, I found a store that had a wide range of trading cards. From Pokémon to Magic: The Gathering, this store had it covered. Amongst their collection, there were a few notable items. The most expensive was an original Magic: The Gathering deck, still shrink-wrapped, for sale at ¥1,300,000. In USD, that converts to roughly $11,887. There were also a few Black Lotus cards with price tags that ranged from ¥580,000 to ¥600,000.</p> <hr /> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/dist/img/black_lotus.jpg" alt="Black Lotus card" /></p> <hr /> </div> </div> <div class="container-mid"> <div class="projects"> <a class="project-card project-active" href="/2018/04/15/japan-blog-07.html"> <div class="project"> <h2>Japan Blog 07</h2> <small>Apr 15, 2018</small> <h5>For the final full day in Tokyo, Japan, I wanted to visit Ikebukuro for the Pokémon Center and revisit Akihabara.
