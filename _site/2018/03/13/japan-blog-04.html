My first thought was that I should go back to sleep. But to my body, it was time to get up. Through the window in the hotel room, I could see that the night life was still active down the block. People crossed the street, off to the next hostess club or karaoke bar. A lone taxi cab weaved past them without a honk of a horn. An ambulance and firetruck were parked on a corner with the sirens on but I couldn’t see what for.</p> <p>I laid in bed for a few hours and listened to the few songs that I had on my iPhone. There wasn’t much to choose from. I must have played 2Pac’s ‘My Block’, about twelve or thirteen times. When the sun started to rise around six, I decided to get ready. I got a quick shower, dressed, brushed my teeth and packed my camera gear inside of my backpack.</p> <p>The hallway was empty and silent as I exited my room around seven. I took the first elevator down to reception and another down to the first floor. The main entrance that I had came in the past night was gated off this early in the day. So I exited via the back entrance, where the taxis typically park. There were a few bellhops about but otherwise this area too was empty.</p> <p>I took a side street back towards the front of the hotel. To my left, two younger males held up an apparent drunken or drugged female as she stumbled down the blacktop. They all laughed and shouted, an end to a good night in Kabukicho. Above me, to my right, I heard a guttural ‘croak’. It was a massive raven. The bird perched itself on a nearby neon sign. I looked to the surrounding rooftops and saw even more ravens. They were everywhere.</p> <p>In the front of the hotel, I stopped and checked Google Maps for nearby places to eat. The last time I had ate was on the plane, so I was famished. But as I had learned with prior research, the majority of businesses in Japan do not open early in the morning. The average time was either eleven or noon. However, I was in luck. There was one place open. Burger King. That’s right, my first bite to eat in Tokyo was to be at Burger King.</p> <p>The nearest Burger King was a short walk from the Hotel Gracery. It took me around ten or so minutes on foot. I entered through a pair of sliding doors, which were propped open with a wet floor sign. Instead of approaching the counter immediately, I stood back and glanced over the menu. I picked an Ham and cheese Kurowa’ sandwich, which came with french fries. I took out a thousand yen note from my passport holder and approached the counter. I said, “Good Morning”, in Japanese to an older woman behind the counter. She returned the greeting and asked me what I would like. I placed my order, placed the yen note on a small tray and waited for my change. In return, she gave me a 500 yen coin and range of other coins.</p> <p>I took my food tray and walked up the flight of stairs to the right of the counter. Upstairs, numerous men and women ate their breakfast in silence. I found a seat immediately to the front of the staircase. Towards the back of the staircase was the smoking room. The room is walled off with a sliding door. No one inside seemed to mind to have a cigarette with a bite to eat. But at least they were polite enough to keep the doors closed for the rest of the customers.</p> <p>After breakfast I headed down a side street in the direction of the hotel. It was empty or so I thought. A woman came out of a small shack and gestured me over. She offered me oral sex in exchange for three thousand yen. I turned her down with a smile and proceeded down the street. She beckoned me with a lower price as I continued to walk. A second woman approached me about fifty yards further and asked if I was interested in a massage. I politely refused. When a third woman also offered me a service nearby, it was clear that this was not a street I wanted to be on.</p> </div> </div> <div class="container-mid"> <div class="projects"> <a class="project-card project-active" href="/2018/03/13/japan-blog-04.html"> <div class="project"> <h2>Japan Blog 04</h2> <small>Mar 13, 2018</small> <h5>I woke at around three in the morning.
