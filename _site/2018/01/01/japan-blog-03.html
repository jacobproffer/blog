I did not expect this. In my mind, I had hopes to make it to Shinjuku and locate my hotel before nightfall. But it gets dark in Japan earlier than back home. It was six in the evening but it felt much later. I followed the progress of the train on my phone through Google Maps as the train snaked through small towns and past open fields. We pulled into Nippori Station roughly an hour later. This is where I had to make the switch from the Skyliner to the JR Line. The issue was that I had no idea how to get to the correct platform.</p> <p>I exited the train and looked around. There was an escalator to my left that went upstairs and the end of the platform to my front. But there were no signs. I approached an older man and asked in Japanese if he spoke English. He shook his head and waved me on. I then walked up to a younger man behind him and pointed at my phone on which I had brought up a map of Shinjuku. He pointed up the escalator. I thanked him and bowed. He returned the bow and smiled.</p> <p>Upstairs I spotted a security guard and showed him my ticket. He waved me through the ticket gate and guided me to an escalator that led down to another platform. I was tired, so I decided not to walk down the escalator. Instead, I stood to the left. I had heard that this was custom in Japan. It felt backwards but sure enough, a few people passed me on my right.</p> <p>When I reached the ground level, I headed towards the nearby platform. The train that arrived had cars similar to what I was used to in New York City. The one real difference is heated seats, which weirded me out. I didn’t sit for too long though. More people got onto the train and I offered my seat to an older woman. But when the train rolled out of the station, I braced myself while I held onto one of the plastic grips that hung down from the rails inside of the car. It was a jerky ride but that’s typical for any subway.</p> <p>As we neared Shinjuku station, an announcement came over the intercom. First in Japanese, followed by an English translation, “The next stop is Shinjuku Station.” I tightened the straps of my bag and glanced around the car. Most of the young males aboard were focused on their cell-phones or game devices. One of them watched a Twitch streamer play Cuphead on his iPhone. But what amazed me was how quiet it was aboard. No one talked or even whispered. It was an odd but pleasant experience.</p> <p>The train made it to Shinjuku station in roughly twenty-two minutes. I had read prior to my trip that Shinjuku was the busiest subway station in the world. It provided service to over three million people each day. And it was obvious how that number was reached. Outside the windows of my car, I could see people everywhere. As I exited the car, I immediately located a sign for the East exit. The East exit, I learned from prior research, would lead me to Kabukicho where my hotel was located. I weaved in and out of crowds, making my way down a large set of stairs to the base floor of the station. The downstairs was filled with even more people. It was almost shoulder to shoulder. I truly had to watch where I walked to avoid running into anyone.</p> <p>While I kept an eye on my surroundings, I also looked for the yellow overhead signs. There were signs for other exits, such as North and South. There were also signs for other platforms. The sign for Kabukicho, which I found after a few minutes, pointed up a set of stairs that lead to an exit.</p> <hr /> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/dist/img/kabukicho_sign.jpg" alt="Kabukicho Sign" /></p> <hr /> </div> <ul class="list"> <li><a class="active-link" href="/2018/01/01/japan-blog-03.html">Japan Blog 03 / Jan 1, 2018</a></li> <li><a href="/2017/12/28/japan-blog-02.html">Japan Blog 02 / Dec 28, 2017</a></li> <li><a href="/2017/12/12/japan-blog-01.html">Japan Blog 01 / Dec 12, 2017</a></li> <li><a href="/2017/11/13/japan-blog-00.html">Japan Blog 00 / Nov 13, 2017</a></li> </ul> </div> </section> </main> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/dist/js/app.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> </body> </html>
