Once off the plane, I was corralled towards the main terminal with the rest of the passengers. But unlike in Tokyo, Japan, I didn’t have to immediately go through customs. I was able to link-up with Myles, my travel partner for the trip, near a small cafe. We attempted to get some coffee but all of the stores within this section of the airport required an outgoing boarding pass.</p> <p>With our quest for coffee postponed, we headed towards customs. Since the airport in Keflavik is so small, the few lines to go through customs were small. It took roughly ten minutes in total. I wasn’t even asked any questions about why I was in the country. I just smiled, greeted the worker and my passport was stamped for entry into Iceland. Myles, however, was asked how long he would be in the country. Maybe it does help to put on a little charm.</p> <p>Once out of customs, Myles and I made our way down towards the exit of the airport on the ground floor. Along the way, we were forced to walk through a duty free shop. The store primarily sold a wide range of liquor, snacks and electronic goods. But no coffee. Then we spotted a Dunkin’ Donuts in one of the corners, only to find out that they didn’t serve coffee. The worker pointed at a coffee pot in the back and said, “Coffee machine.” I was disappointed to say the least.</p> <p>Afterwards, it was time to checkout the rental vehicle. Expedia set us up with an automatic SUV through Europcar, a French car rental company. All that was needed was a valid drivers license and a few signatures at the counter. Once cleared, Myles and I were assigned a Toyota RAV4. The vehicle had plenty of space, four-wheel drive and appeared somewhat new. The only downside was that our model did not have on-board GPS. Thankfully, I had full cell coverage and Google Maps.</p> <p>I was up first for driving, which I admit I was somewhat skeptical about. More so because I’ve barely driven anywhere outside of Gwinn or Marquette. But for the most part, the laws of the road in Iceland are similar to back home. The one major difference is that speed is determined in kilometers instead of miles per hour. The most common speed on paved roads is ninety kilometers, which is nearly fifty-six miles per hour. On long stretches of road, it felt super slow.</p> <p>Our first stop was the Blue Lagoon. We originally considered going into the geothermal spa but the price was nine-thousand Icelandic króna or eighty-five dollars. Instead, Myles and I had some coffee at the cafe, used the washroom and continued on out towards the coast. Near the Blue Lagoon, we caught sight of Grindavík, which is a fishing town on the Southern Peninsula of Iceland. We pulled off the road near the top of a hill and had an almost panoramic view of the town.</p> <hr /> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/dist/img/grindavikurbaer_1.jpg" alt="Grindavikurbaer" /> <img src="http://localhost:4000/dist/img/grindavikurbaer_2.jpg" alt="Grindavikurbaer" /></p> <hr /> <p>Test</p> </div> </div> <div class="container-mid"> <div class="projects"> <a class="project-card project-active" href="/2018/05/25/iceland-01.html"> <div class="project"> <h2>Iceland Blog 01</h2> <small>May 25, 2018</small> <h5>The Boeing 757 touched down in Iceland around six thirty in the morning on Tuesday, May 15th.
