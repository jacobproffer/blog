The process only required the return of the room key. I considered breakfast at the Bonsalute Kabuki on the ground floor but decided to head to the Shinjuku Station instead. Although my flight wasn’t until six at night, I wanted to have plenty of time for the train ride, security and customs. I also planned to have a few hours to walk around the airport before the thirteen hour flight.</p> <p>But I wouldn’t be able to leave Shinjuku for a few hours yet. At Shinjuku Station, I was told that the next Skyliner train to Narita wouldn’t leave for nearly two hours. I still purchased a ticket and found my way to a set of stairs that lead up to the designated platform. Though as with Ikebukuro, I decided to remain below ground to stay out of the chilled air in the morning. The good news is that I made a friend throughout the wait. I met Vic, a traveler from Belgium.</p> <p>By far one of the nicest people I’d met in awhile, Vic had also been traveling throughout Tokyo. He was on his way to catch a flight to another portion of Japan. We discussed our thoughts on Tokyo, the red-light district and what wards we’d been to. He also expressed his concern for his flight, due to the extended wait for the train. Thankfully the train arrived on time, a little before eleven. Vic and I said our goodbyes and parted ways, as his ticket put him in another part of the train.</p> <p>The ride to Narita was peaceful. No one on the train spoke and I had my own comfortable seat. Throughout the ride, I saw a few small towns and a lot of the country side. When we pulled into the station of Narita Airport, I grabbed my bag, deboarded and made my way upstairs to the ticket counters. It surprised me how few of people there were in this section of the airport. I was able to check-in quickly and was guided straight to an empty security checkpoint for American Airlines.</p> </div> </div> <div class="container-mid"> <div class="projects"> <a class="project-card project-active" href="/2018/05/03/japan-blog-08.html"> <div class="project"> <h2>Japan Blog 08</h2> <small>May 3, 2018</small> <h5>As much I hated to do so, I checked out of the Hotel Gracery on Monday morning around eight.
