But as of today, the language has been part of my daily life for eight months. I thought it would be a hobby for a short time and then I&amp;rsquo;d get bored or too frustrated. As of now, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned hiragana (ひりがな), katakana (カタカナ) and a vast number of kanji (漢字) characters and vocabulary. I can carry basic conversations, write, type and even read a little.</description></item><item><title>Hiragana Progress</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/education/hiragana-progress/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jul 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/education/hiragana-progress/</guid><description>Another month has passed, which marks my second month of study with Japanese. Throughout the month of July, I made steady progress with the first Japanese From Zero! book. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m on lesson five. The lesson covers a few more Hiragana characters and likes and dislikes. Out of all of the words I currently know, my favorite word is みみ (耳). It means &amp;lsquo;ear&amp;rsquo; and is pronounced, &amp;lsquo;mi-mi&amp;rsquo;. The word reminds me of the Road Runner&amp;rsquo;s, &amp;ldquo;Beep beep (Meep meep)&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Learning Hiragana</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/education/learning-hiragana/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/education/learning-hiragana/</guid><description>There was a time where I could speak Russian. I also had the ability to read Cyrillic script, while also being able to write it in cursive. All of which I learned to do from a Russian professor in 2011. But once I completed the course, I abandoned the language. Within the last year, I regained interest. Solely because I thought my first international trip was to be to Moscow, Russia.</description></item></channel></rss>
