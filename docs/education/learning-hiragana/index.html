      <h1>Learning Hiragana</h1>
    </header>
    <p>There was a time where I could speak Russian. I also had the ability to read Cyrillic script, while also being able to write it in cursive. All of which I learned to do from a Russian professor in 2011. But once I completed the course, I abandoned the language. Within the last year, I regained interest. Solely because I thought my first international trip was to be to Moscow, Russia. Unfortunately, the trip was scrapped after an incident in Saint Petersburg and so was my interest in the language.</p>

<p>With an intent to return to Japan this fall to visit Osaka and Kyoto, I&rsquo;ve begun to study Japanese. I&rsquo;m nearly a month into the first Japanese From Zero! book, which covers Hiragana. If I complete the book, I&rsquo;ll be able to move onto Katakana. Although I&rsquo;d say my progress isn&rsquo;t fast, I&rsquo;m amazed at how much I&rsquo;ve learned within the first month. I can count to over 10,000, properly introduce myself, properly come and go from a house, create sentences and ask questions.</p>

<p>I also learned Japanese pronunciation, which is incredibly important. It is an eye opener to see how words can change depending upon how they are pronounced. For example, I would say, &ldquo;kyuu sai,&rdquo; for nine years old. Notice that there are two u&rsquo;s, or rather two vowels, next to each other. This means that the sound needs to be lengthened. If I were to pronounce it as, &ldquo;kusai&rdquo;, the meaning changes to smelly.</p>

<p>The only difficult part about proceeding with this language is that I don&rsquo;t have anyone personally to practice with at the time. I rely on the course recordings online, the information provided in the book and the occasional lesson on Duolingo. But I am excited to push forward and see how much progress I can make by the fall. The overall goal by that point is to know enough Hiragana where I do not have to speak English in Japan. Hopefully one day I&rsquo;ll be able to consider myself fluent.</p>
