The final night before I commence my trip to the beautiful country of Norway. For the next week, Myles Kedrowski and I will be staying in the city of Bergen. Similar to our venture to Iceland, Myles and I will fly separate flights but meet up at the airport. He should arrive a few hours after I do on Friday afternoon. Our itinerary consists of nearly non-stop hiking throughout the north and south west of Norway. Thankfully, we&rsquo;ll cover the great distances between locations by car.</p><p>Compared to Iceland, hotel and flights were relatively cheap. In fact, I could go to Norway three times for the price I paid for Iceland. With that said, I&rsquo;ll have to see the final cost of food, beverages and souvenirs. My primary concern is the cost of fuel as I&rsquo;m uncertain how often the car will need to be fueled up. There will also be a variety of toll and ferry fees on top of that to consider. But Myles and I have agreed to split all costs related to the vehicle.</p><p>Weather wise, the forecast is a mix of rain, clouds and a bit of sun. The temperature range should stay between high thirties to forties. To be prepared for the majority of scenarios, Myles and I have weatherproofed all of our gear. We have dry bags with waterproof clothes. Iceland taught me a variety lessons but the main one was to stay dry. On top of rainwear, I&rsquo;ve even packed a heavier down jacket into a compression bag for colder days. As we&rsquo;ll sometimes be higher in the mountains, I don&rsquo;t want to run the risk of not having enough layers.</p><p>Overall, I&rsquo;m excited and grateful to have this opportunity. Norway will be my third country within one year, which is a bit of a shock.</p><p>Wish me luck.</p></div></article><div class=post__pagination><div class="container container--small"><div class="grid grid--pagination"><a class="post__pagination-item post__pagination-item--prev" href=http://jacobproffer.com/travel/iceland-blog-07/>Previous Post
