Tonight is my last full night within the United States, at least for the next week. As of Wednesday morning, I will touch down at Narita International Airport. Which, if you didn&rsquo;t know, is in Tokyo, Japan.</p><p>This will technically be my second international venture. Though I personally consider it to be my first. I&rsquo;ve been out of the country once before, many years ago. My dad took me fishing in Canada, back before you were required to have a passport. I remember being stung by a bee, which I&rsquo;ve always since referred to as, &ldquo;That Canadian bee&rdquo;. This was sometime in the late nineties. We had drove into Ontario through the International Bridge.</p><p>But I obviously can&rsquo;t drive to Japan. I&rsquo;ll be flying on a Boeing: 787 Dreamliner for thirteen hours, out of Chicago. This will be after I catch a short flight from Sawyer to O&rsquo;Hare. I&rsquo;ve heard there&rsquo;s free beer and wine, which is the good news. There&rsquo;s also the added addition of lunch and dinner, with every seat having a television. The bad news is that I don&rsquo;t expect to get much sleep, which means jet lag. I&rsquo;ve packed some medication, as a last resort.</p><p>The silver lining is Hotel Gracery, otherwise known as the <a href=http://godzilla.wikia.com/wiki/Godzilla_Head>Godzilla</a> hotel. Built in 2015, the hotel is located in the heart of the area around Shinjuku Stationâ€™s East Exit. This location provides me with easy access to the busiest railway station in the world, as well as central Shinjuku. My home for nearly a week, Shinjuku is a major commercial and administrative centre. I don&rsquo;t plan to shop much in this area but rather to use it as a hub to areas such as Akihabara.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be heading to the airport in around six hours for my first flight. Wish me luck.</p></div></article><div class="pagination pagination--post"><div class="container container--small"><div class="grid grid--pagination"><a class="pagination-item pagination-item--next" href=http://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-01/>Next Post
