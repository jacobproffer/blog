<span>- 2 min read</span><h1>Japan Blog 10</h1></header><p>I&rsquo;ve never flown domestically within another country before this trip to Japan. I was unsure of what the process would be like. But it&rsquo;s the same as it is within the United States. After immigration and customs, I only had to go through security. Though I didn&rsquo;t realize until I was in the domestic terminal that I was not flying American Airlines to Osaka. I would fly Japan Airlines, which I had never flown before.</p><p>The airlines changed my seat last minute and I ended up in premium economy, right before business. I am unsure if it was an upgrade or to balance out the plane. In any case, the Boeing 787-9 is fantastic. My seat had a few buttons, which turned the chair into a recliner. There also was a slide out tablet, but I fell asleep quickly. I woke up a few minutes prior to touchdown at Osaka International Airport.</p><hr><figure><img src=/images/japan_airlines.jpg alt="Japan Airlines Boeing 787-9."><figcaption><p>Japan Airlines Boeing 787-9</p></figcaption></figure><hr><p>After I deboarded the plane, I took the monorail into the city. Compared to the prices of buses and taxis, the train is a much cheaper option. The only drawback is that it is much slower due to all of the stops at various stations. That and there&rsquo;s also the complex structure of the Osaka subway system. But from Osaka International Airport, only two steps are required to reach Namba Station. First, take the monorail to Senri-Chūō Station. Then from Senri-Chūō, purchase a ticket to Namba Station.</p><p>The Sarasa Hotel Namba, my hotel for the week, is a short walk away from Namba Station in Nipponbashi. Although small in size, the hotel is in a perfect location for those interested in anime, books, manga, toys, etc. It&rsquo;s also within walking distance to Dōtonbori. The rooms are small and narrow but for a solo traveler, I found my room to be appropriate in size. However, I would say the bathroom was awkward to get into. It was about the size of a small broom closet with a half bathtub.</p><p>Although late at night, I decided to venture out to the nearby stores before bed. There were a few still open nearby the hotel. Mostly book stores and a few hobby shops. I was on the hunt for Japanese language textbooks and a Japanese version of I Am a Hero. But most of the bookstores open carried only manga that I wasn&rsquo;t interested in or adult material such as hentai. Eventually, the jet lag caught up with me and I returned to the hotel for a long sleep.</p><footer><small class=category>travel</small></footer></div></article><div class="pagination pagination--post"><div class="container container--small"><div class="grid grid--pagination"><a class="pagination-item pagination-item--prev" href=https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-09/>Previous Post
