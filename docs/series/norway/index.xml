With an average time of twenty minutes to cross, Myles and I were able to use the bathroom, take pictures and even grab food from the onboard deli. The only downside is that the ferry crosses once per hour. We arrived early Sunday morning to an empty dock with a single employee present. Although patient, Myles and I were concerned that the delay would cost us sunlight.</description></item><item><title>Norway Blog 02</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/norway-blog-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/norway-blog-02/</guid><description>Norway has a lot of tunnels. The majority are short, between a half mile to a few miles long. There are a few that surpass ten with the longest being fifteen miles long. The length depends on the location and the span of the fjord. The majority of these tunnels are two lane, fully lit with emergency telephones. Yet there are also tunnels that are so narrow that only one vehicle can pass through at a time.</description></item><item><title>Norway Blog 01</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/norway-blog-01/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/norway-blog-01/</guid><description>I touched down in Norway to a sunny view of distant fjords, islands and a fleet of helicopters. It was nine in the morning, four hours before Myles was due to fly in. Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any luggage to claim, I bought a cup of coffee and relaxed in the main lounge. The Bergen airport is small in size, which left little to explore. But the nearby gates seemed to be busy.</description></item><item><title>Norway Blog 00</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/norway-blog-00/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/norway-blog-00/</guid><description>This is it. The final night before I commence my trip to the beautiful country of Norway. For the next week, Myles Kedrowski and I will be staying in the city of Bergen. Similar to our venture to Iceland, Myles and I will fly separate flights but meet up at the airport. He should arrive a few hours after I do on Friday afternoon. Our itinerary consists of nearly non-stop hiking throughout the north and south west of Norway.</description></item></channel></rss>
