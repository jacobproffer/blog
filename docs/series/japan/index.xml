The game takes place in 1988 and is set in Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s Kabukichō and Osaka&amp;rsquo;s Dōtonbori. The attention to detail in the game is superb, with stores such as Don Quijote, stray cats and the Tombori River walk. There is even a mission that spans the length of the Ebisu bridge, where you help defend a teen from thugs.</description></item><item><title>Japan Blog 10</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2019 18:41:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-10/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never flown domestically within another country before this trip to Japan. I was unsure of what the process would be like. But it&amp;rsquo;s the same as it is within the United States. After immigration and customs, I only had to go through security. Though I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize until I was in the domestic terminal that I was not flying American Airlines to Osaka. I would fly Japan Airlines, which I had never flown before.</description></item><item><title>Japan Blog 09</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-09/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-09/</guid><description>This is it. Tomorrow morning, I embark on my second trip to Japan. For the next week, I&amp;rsquo;ll explore Osaka, Kyoto and Nara. Compared to Tokyo, I expect similarities but a much different experience. Primarily, I will be open to experiment with unfamiliar foods. At the top of my list is takoyaki, which is a ball-shaped Japanese snack. It&amp;rsquo;s typically filled with octopus. There&amp;rsquo;s also kushikatsu, which is basically fried food on a skewer.</description></item><item><title>Japan Blog 08</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-08/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-08/</guid><description>As much I hated to return the room key, I checked out of the Hotel Gracery on Monday morning around eight. I considered breakfast at the Bonsalute Kabuki on the ground floor on my way out but decided to head to the Shinjuku Station instead. Although my flight wasn&amp;rsquo;t until six at night, I wanted to have plenty of time for the train ride, security and customs. I also planned to have a few hours to walk around the airport before the thirteen hour flight.</description></item><item><title>Japan Blog 07</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-07/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-07/</guid><description>For the final full day in Tokyo, Japan, I wanted to visit Ikebukuro for the Pokémon Center and revisit Akihabara. Which meant that it was going to be a long day. But I still made time for breakfast at the Bonsalute Kabuki. I mixed it up this time and try some noodles and white rice. But I also had potatoes and sausages with orange juice. Even though the food was delicious and it was a buffet, the restaurant was pricey at nearly three-thousand yen.</description></item><item><title>Japan Blog 06</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-06/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-06/</guid><description>Saturday in Tokyo was unique. I slept in for once, which provided an opportunity to seek breakfast somewhere other than Burger King. I tried out the breakfast buffet at the Bonsalute Kabuki, which was located on the ground floor of the hotel. The restaurant served Italian food throughout the day. But in the morning, there was a choice of Western or Japanese breakfast foods. I enjoyed a meal of potatoes, sausages and croissants with second helpings.</description></item><item><title>Japan Blog 05</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-05/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-05/</guid><description>Friday morning, I was out the door by seven. Breakfast was at Burger King, my new usual spot in Shinjuku. It was cheap, familiar and no one bothered me. I finished my food and walked over to Shinjuku Station, where I attempted to use one of the JR Line ticket booths. There was an English translation but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out what ticket I needed. Thankfully, there was a service center.</description></item><item><title>Japan Blog 04</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-04/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-04/</guid><description>I woke around three in the morning. Through the window in the hotel room, I could see that the night life was still active down the block. A group of people crossed the street, off to a hostess club or karaoke bar. A lone taxi cab weaved past them. An ambulance and firetruck were parked on a corner to their right with the sirens on but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see what for.</description></item><item><title>Japan Blog 03</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-03/</guid><description>It was dark when the train pulled out of Narita. I did not expect this. In my mind, I had hopes to make it to Shinjuku and locate my hotel before nightfall. But it gets dark in Japan earlier than back home. It was six in the evening but it felt much later. I followed the progress of the train on my phone through Google Maps as the train snaked through small towns and past open fields.</description></item><item><title>Japan Blog 02</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2017 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-02/</guid><description>Immigration is a strange place to be alone, especially if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak the native language. I remember walking into Narita&amp;rsquo;s immigration. There&amp;rsquo;s a large green sign above the entrance that reads, &amp;ldquo;Quarantine&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d never been through the immigration process before but I had an idea of what to expect. You fill out some paperwork, get your photo taken and your passport is reviewed. It&amp;rsquo;s simple. The strange part was that everyone around me spoke a foreign language.</description></item><item><title>Japan Blog 01</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-01/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2017 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-01/</guid><description>6265 miles. That&amp;rsquo;s how far I had to travel to get to Tokyo, Japan. Thankfully, I managed to due so in comfort aboard an American Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The flight, spanning 13 hours and 15 minutes, took place on a Tuesday afternoon out of Chicago O&amp;rsquo;hare International Airport.
I remember walking up to my designated gate, K5. The plane was about to reach the jet bridge as I took a seat in the lounge.</description></item><item><title>Japan Blog 00</title><link>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-00/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2017 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobproffer.com/travel/japan-blog-00/</guid><description>This is it. Tonight is my last full night within the United States, at least for the next week. As of Wednesday morning, I will touch down at Narita International Airport. Which, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, is in Tokyo, Japan.
This will technically be my second international venture. Though I personally consider it to be my first. I&amp;rsquo;ve been out of the country once before, many years ago. My dad took me fishing in Canada, back before you were required to have a passport.</description></item></channel></rss>
