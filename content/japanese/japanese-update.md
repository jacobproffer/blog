Four years have gone by without a Japanese post. Since I wrote [Two Years Studying Japanese]({{< ref "/japanese/two-years-studying-japanese.md" >}}) in 2020, I've continued to study Japanese every day.

## Anki

## Crystal Hunters

An invaluable resource I came across for reading Japanese is a manga series called [Crystal Hunters](https://crystalhuntersmanga.com/), which was created by language learners for language learners. The first book is available in a variety of languages but recent entries are available in either English or Japanese. With Japanese, two versions are available. The natural Japanese version has kanji with no furigana, while the standard Japanese version provides furgina. No matter the choice, vocabulary and grammar concepts are basic in the first entry but are enhanced from book to book.

Although not required, I recommend to have knowledge of hiragana and katakana before reading Crystal Hunters. A kana chart is provided for free on the Crystal Hunters website but the series does not solely teach either part of the Japanese writing system. Each panel of the manga is in Japanese, with kanji, with no on-page translation. Though as mentioned, furigana is available in the standard Japanese version.

## From Zero

## WaniKani

A variety of methods exit to learn kanji today. [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/), which utilizes spaced repetition and mnemonics, has been my favorite since 2018. Each level on WaniKani introduces new radicals, kanji, and associated vocabulary. When a new kanji or vocabulary word is presented for the first time, a mnemonic is introduced. Each mnemonic act as a short story, which aids in remembering the meaning. For example, the on'yomi reading for "lose" is {{< japanese >}}ふ{{< /japanese >}} (fu). The kanji for lose, {{< japanese >}}負{{< /japanese >}}, is constructed with two radicals, prison and shellfish. The mnemonic for lose is, "If you lose, you're a fool ({{< japanese >}}ふ{{< /japanese >}})."

With this system, I've learned hundreds of kanji and vocabulary words. To reduce burnout, I recently set my new lessons for each day to five. Although the reduction slows daily progress, I use the extra time to work on Wanikani reviews, Anki decks and reading with Satori Reader.
