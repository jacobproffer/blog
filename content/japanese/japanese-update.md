Nearly four years have gone by without a Japanese post. It's odd to review [Two Years Studying Japanese]({{< ref "/japanese/two-years-studying-japanese.md" >}}) from 2020.

## Crystal Hunters

An invaluable resource I came across for reading Japanese is a manga called [Crystal Hunters](https://crystalhuntersmanga.com/), which was created by language learners for language learners. The first book is available in a variety of languages but recent entries are available in either English or Japanese. With Japanese, two versions are available. The natural Japanese version has kanji with no furigana, while the standard Japanese version provides furgina. No matter the choice, vocabulary and grammar concepts are basic in the first entry but are enhanced from book to book.

Although not required, I recommend to have a strong knowledge of hiragana and katakana before reading Crystal Hunters. A kana chart is provided for free on the Crystal Hunters website but the series does not solely teach either part of the Japanese writing system. Each panel of the manga is in Japanese, with kanji, with no on-page translation. Though as mentioned, furigana is available in the standard Japanese version.
