Yesterday, I started to learn about the different uses of {{< japanese >}}もう{{ /japanese }}. The word {{<japanese>}}もう{{< /japanese >}} can be used to say, "already", "more" or "anymore". Depending upon what the word is placed in front of determines that meaning.

When placed in front of a positive past tense verb, {{< japanese >}}もう{{ /japanese }} means "already". As in, something has already been done. So it can be used to express that you've already ate or been somewhere. For example, you could ask {{< japanese >}}もう行きましたか。{{< /japanese >}} - Have you already gone? An affirmative response could be, {{< japanese >}}はい、もう行きました。{{< /japanese >}} - Yes, I have already gone.
