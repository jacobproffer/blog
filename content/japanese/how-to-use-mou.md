Yesterday, I started to learn about the different uses of {{< japanese >}}もう{{< /japanese >}}. The word {{<japanese>}}もう{{< /japanese >}} can be used to say, "already", "more" or "anymore." Depending upon what the word is placed in front of determines that meaning.

When placed in front of a positive past tense verb, {{< japanese >}}もう{{< /japanese >}} means "already." As in, something has already been done. It can be used to express that you've already ate or been somewhere. For example, you could ask, {{< japanese >}}もう行きましたか。{{< /japanese >}} - "Have you already gone?" An affirmative response would be, {{< japanese >}}はい、もう行きました。{{< /japanese >}} - "Yes, I have already gone." A negative response could be, {{< japanese >}}いいえ、まだです。{{< /japanese >}} - "No, not yet."

In front of a counter word, such as {{< japanese >}}一つ{{< /japanese >}} (One thing), {{< japanese >}}もう{{< /japanese >}} means "more." For example, {{< japanese >}}もう一つ{{< /japanese >}} means, "One more." Or imagine you're at a restaurant and one of your friends is late. This could be a situation where you could say, {{< japanese >}}もう一人{{< /japanese >}} - "One more person."

The other main usage of {{< japanese >}}もう{{< /japanese >}} is to say "anymore." This can be established by placing the word in front of a negative verb. This form can be useful to express that you don't go somewhere or drink anymore. However, "anymore" can also be expressed with the use of {{< japanese >}}もう{{< /japanese >}} and {{< japanese >}}じゃない{{< /japanese >}} placed after a word. For example, you could say, {{< japanese >}}大阪もう行くじゃないです。{{< /japanese >}} - "I am not going to Osaka anymore."
