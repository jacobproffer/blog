{{< japanese >}}よく{{< /japanese >}} and {{< japanese >}}あんまり{{< /japanese >}} are two useful words in Japanese. {{< japanese >}}よく{{< /japanese >}} is used to say, "Often," when placed in front of positive verbs. {{< japanese >}}あんまり{{< /japanese >}} is used to express, "Not often," when used with negative verbs.

So if I want to write that I often go to a certain location, say Tokyo, I could write, {{< japanese >}}よく東京に行きます。{{< /japanese >}} - "I often go to Tokyo." But since I don't often go to Tokyo, I could instead write, {{< japanese >}}東京にあんまり行きません。{{< /japanese >}} - "I don't go to Tokyo much." Note the positive and negative verb endings in both examples.
