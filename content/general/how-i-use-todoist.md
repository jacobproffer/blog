Four years ago, I was introduced to [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) by [Bugsy Sailor](https://bugsy.me/).

Note that tags and filters are both part of the Premium subscription of Todoist.

## Projects and Sections

I have two primary projects with Todoist, Personal and Work. By having only two parent projects, I can visualize and organize sub-projects, which are projects nested under the parent projects.

### Personal Project

The Personal project contains a number of sections for general tasks. For example, there is a section labeled Apartment and another section labeled Errands. Personal hobbies, such as learning Japanese or reading, are set as sub-projects since both contain topic-related sections. For my Japanese project, I have sections for yearly goals, tools to research, daily study tasks and immersion. The Reading project contains sections for different mediums with articles or books that I'd like to read.

* Personal
  * Finances
  * Japanese
    * Goals (Year 3)
    * Immersion
    * Tools
    * Study
  * Reading
  * Routines

### Work Project

There are currently two sections for the Work project, Meetings and Miscellaneous. The Miscellaenous section is where I add small tasks such as updating a food menu for a client or looking into the occassional site error. These tasks typically take anywhere from five minutes to an hour. For clients with robust projects, such as a website build, I create individual projects with kanban style sections.

* Work
  * Client 1
    * Action Items
    * In Progress
  * Client 2
  * Client 3

## Labels

Whenever I create a new task with Todoist, I ask myself three questions:

* How much time will it take to complete the task?
* What time of the day makes sense to complete the task?
* Where does the task need to be completed?

Those three questions help me decide what labels to add to the task. For example, I add the following labels for a stand-up meeting at work in the morning at the office:

* 15min (15 minutes)
* morning
* at_work

## Filters

Filters allow me to view tasks based upon a specific date, tag or even a combination of dates and tags. I set-up a number of filters to help me quickly few tasks for certain times of the day at home or at work.

Note that `@` denotes a label.

### Work: Today

Query: `@at_work & today`

### Work: Morning

Query: `(@at_work & @morning) & today`
