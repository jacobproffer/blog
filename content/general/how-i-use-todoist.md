Four years ago, I was introduced to [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) by [Bugsy Sailor](https://bugsy.me/).

## Projects and Sections

I have two primary projects with Todoist, Personal and Work. By only having two parent projects, I can easily visualize and organize sub-projects.

### Personal Project

The Personal project contains a number of sections to keep general tasks organized. There is a section labeled Apartment and another section labeled Errands. Personal hobbies, such as learning Japanese or reading, are set as individual projects since both contain their own topic-related sections. For my Japanese project, I have sections for yearly goals, tools to research, daily study tasks and immersion. The Reading project contains sections for different mediums with articles or books that I'd like to read.

I'm also an avid user of the [Todoist](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/todoist/) extension for Firefox. The extension allows me to quickly add articles to my Articles section, so that I can come back and read an article when I have time.

* Personal
  * Finances
  * Japanese
  * Reading
  * Routines

### Work Project

There are currently two sections for the primary Work project, Meetings and Miscellaneous. The Miscellaenous section is where I add one-off tasks, such as updating a food menu for a client or looking into a PHP error. These tasks typically take anywhere from five minutes to a half hour.

For clients with robust projects, such as a website build, I create individual projects.

* Work
  * Client 1
  * Client 2
  * Client 3

## Labels

Whenever I create a new task with Todoist, I ask myself three questions:

* How much time do I think the task will take to complete
* What time of the day makes sense to complete the task
* Where does the task need to be completed

Those three questions help me decide what labels to add to the task. For example, for a stand-up meeting at work every Monday morning at the office, I add the following labels:

* 15min (15 minutes)
* morning
* at_work
