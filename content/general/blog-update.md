Hello everyone, it's been a few months. I've been busy with personal projects, work and studying Japanese. The plan is to start catching up with the blog this week. I have a number of Japan posts to write and I'm anxious to do so. I also intend to write more occassional posts to let everyone know what exactly I am learning with Japanese.

On a more technical note, I spent the day setting up the Netlify CMS. This is the first time that I've had a content management system for the blog in years. The core of the site is still built around Hugo but I won't have to open my text editor anymore to manage content.
