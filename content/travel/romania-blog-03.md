The Gara de Nord, also known as the Bucharest North railway station, is the primary train station in Bucharest. It provides connections to nearby countries, such as Ukraine, and major cities within Romania, such as Bra»ôov. Located near the center of Bucharest, the station also serves trams, a number of city buses, and an apparent convoy of cabbies near the front entrance at any given time of the day.

With my first steps into the station, I was taken aback by the architecture and overall aesthetic. I stepped back in time.
