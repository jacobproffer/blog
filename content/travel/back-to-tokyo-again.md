In late August, late in the afternoon, I landed at Haneda Airport (Officially, Tokyo International Airport). For the last three trips to Japan, I had always flown into Narita. But it never occurred to me until this year how much closer to central Tokyo Haneda is. There was no need for the Narita Express to get into Tokyo, which is costly and takes forever.

Unlike at Narita, I was de-boarded onto the tarmac and ushered onto a shuttle bus that was packed like sardines. The bus drove around the tarmac, alongside various other flights, until we stopped at a nondescript black building. A police officer stood outside in the middle of the two outer doors, to ensure that no one wondered off I assumed. Immigration and customs were somewhere on the upper floors, accessible via the stairs to the left or the set of escalators to right.

Similar to Narita, there was a lengthy corridor that we were sent down to find the immigration station. Immigration was marked with a large overhead sign that read, "Quarantine", a word I usually associate with zombies. Surprisingly, there was barely a wait. Within five minutes, I was through immigration. Customs was the same, since I had only brought along a backpack. I grabbed one of the free tourist maps by the exit and entered the unsecured part of Haneda, officially back into Japan.
