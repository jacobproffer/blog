In late August, late in the afternoon, I landed at Haneda Airport (Officially, Tokyo International Airport). I was de-boarded onto the tarmac and ushered onto a shuttle bus that was packed like sardines. The bus drove around the tarmac, alongside various other flights, until we stopped at a nondescript black building. A police officer stood outside in the middle of the two outer doors, to ensure that no one wondered off. Immigration and customs were somewhere on the upper floors, accessible via the stairs to the left or the set of escalators to right.

Similar to Narita, there was a lengthy corridor that we were sent down to find the immigration station. Immigration was marked with a large overhead sign that read, "Quarantine", a word I usually associate with zombies. Surprisingly, there was barely a wait. Within five minutes, I was through immigration. Customs was the same, since I had only brought along a backpack. I grabbed one of the free tourist maps by the exit and entered the unsecured part of Haneda.

My first task was to purchase a Suica card, which was near the entry gates to the Tokyo Monorail. The card worked similar to a gift card, which could be loaded with money. The one real perk of the Suica card is that you no longer have to purchase physical tickets for most subway lines. All you do is tap the card onto a senor and as long as you have enough money to cover the fare, you're good to go. The money is automatically deducted from the card each use and is easy to refill. I decided to start with 5,000 yen, which would last a few days at least for traveling around Tokyo.

Once through the monorail gates, I walked up an escalator and into the humid heat of a Japanese summer. It was 86 degrees fahrenheit but the humidity made it feel worse. Along the train platform, hoses shot mist into the air. I stood under one until the train arrived. In my mind, it would be a short ride to Akihabara Station, which was close to Hamamatsuch≈ç Station. But what I did not factor in was the direction in which the train I selected was going. I ended up going the opposite direction, clockwise, and did the full ride of the Yamanote Line. It took a good hour or so to get to Akihabara.
