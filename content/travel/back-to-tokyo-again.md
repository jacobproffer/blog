In late August, late in the afternoon, I landed at Haneda Airport (Officially, Tokyo International Airport). I de-boarded onto the tarmac and was ushered onto a shuttle bus, packed like sardines with the other passengers. The bus drove around the tarmac until we stopped at a nondescript black building with a waiting police officer. Immigration and customs were somewhere on the upper floors of the building, accessible via the stairs to the left or the set of escalators to right.

Immigration was marked with a large overhead sign that read, "Quarantine", a word I usually associate with zombies. Within five minutes, I was through immigration, a rarity in modern international travel. Customs was the same, since I had only brought along a backpack. I grabbed one of the free tourist maps by the exit and entered the unsecured part of Haneda.

My first task was to obtain a Suica card, which could be done near the entry gates to the Tokyo Monorail within the airport. The card worked similar to a gift card, which could be loaded with money. The perk of the Suica card was that it eliminated the need to purchase physical tickets for most subway lines. The money is automatically deducted from the card each use. Why I had never used the card on previous trips remains a mystery. I decided to start with 5,000 yen, which would last a few days at least for traveling around Tokyo.

Once through the monorail gates, I walked up an escalator and into the humid heat of a Japanese summer. It was 86 degrees fahrenheit but the humidity made it feel worse. Along the train platform, hoses shot mist into the air. I stood under one until the train arrived. In my mind, it would be a short ride to Akihabara Station, which was close to Hamamatsuch≈ç Station. But what I did not factor in was the direction in which the train I selected was going. I ended up going the opposite direction, clockwise, and did the full ride of the Yamanote Line. It took forty five minutes to reach Akihabara.

Similar to October of last year, I checked into JR-East's Hotel Mets Akihabara. My previous room was just two doors down. This time, the room provided a side view of the entrance to Akihabara Station. Not a great view but it beat scaffolding. The rest of the room was the same as before. One futuristic toilet, a sizeable bathroom with a tub and standup shower, and two sets of pajamas neatly folded on the end of a full size bed.

Freshened up, I left the hotel and walked to GiGO 3, which used to be one of the Sega arcades in Akihabara. The sixth floor was packed with vintage arcade machines. There were a variety of classic shooter games such as House of the Dead, Terminator 2 and Alien 3 (The Gun). There were also dozens of racing games and competitive fighting game such as the original Street Fighter. But what fascinated me most was The Keisatsukan, also known as Police 911. Released back in 2000, the player acts alone to battle the Yakuza. Plastic gun in hand, I had to physically duck and weave in front of the machine in order to not get hit by an enemy's bullet.

Close to The Keisatsukan, I tried another game called The Typing of the Dead. The game came out in 1999 and requires fast typing to battle the undead. There were two well used keyboards, side by side, in front of a single screen. For 100 yen, a single session lasted between five to ten minutes. In order to succeed, I had to rapidly type romaji characters when prompted. There also was a natural Japanese option but I wasn't sure how far my N4 level kanji knowledge would take me. Anytime I ran out of health, I would scramble to input another 100 yen coin before the timer ran out.

Out of coins, I opened my side bag to grab a 1,000 yen bill to exchange. The money was in my bag but my passport holder was not. In a panic, I checked the top of the coin machine, a nearby vending machine and any game I had played. I sprinted down the six flights of stairs, across a crosswalk and back to the hotel. It dawned on me while in the elevator that I had never brought my passport holder. I had set it down on the desk inside of the room when I first arrived.
