My interest with Osaka started with an action-adventure game called Yakuza 0. The game takes place in 1988 and is set in Tokyo's Kabukichō and Osaka's Dōtonbori. The attention to detail in the game is superb, especially with stores such as Don Quijote, stray cats and the canals of Dōtonbori. There's even a mission that spans the length of the Ebisu bridge, where you help defend a teen from thugs.

That's where I began Friday in Japan, with a few hours in Dōtonbori. The area is around a mile from the Sarasa Hotel in Namba. But it's well within walking distance and easy to find. In the morning, cats walk freely among the canals. Workers clean-up trash while dozens of food stalls are set-up. It's the time to check out the Glico Man sign and Ebisu bridge before the streets are filled with tourists.
