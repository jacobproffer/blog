My interest with Osaka started with an action-adventure game called Yakuza 0. The game takes place in 1988 and is set in Tokyo's Kabukichō and Osaka's Dōtonbori. The attention to detail in the game is superb, with stores such as Don Quijote, stray cats and the canals of Dōtonbori. There is even a mission that spans the length of the Ebisu bridge in Osaka, where you help defend a teen from thugs.

That's where I began Friday in Japan, Dōtonbori. As a central central hub for food in Osaka, there are a wide variety of dishes to try throughout the area. I recommend to try street food. Takoyaki is the most common, which is a ball-shaped snack with diced octopus. There are also dangos, which are Japanese dumplings served on a skewer. I tried mitarashi dangos, which were doused with a sweet soy sauce.

After lunch, I purchased a cocktail from a nearby Lawson. As it is legal to consume alcohol in public in Japan, I had to try it out. My choice was a can of Suntory Holdings' Strong Zero. Popular with young adults, the cocktail only costs around one hundred yen. The taste is similar to lemonade but with a high alcohol percentage. I should note that it is a cultural norm to not walk and drink. Find a bench or stand.

Dōtonbori also has stores for sweets and souvenirs. Glico-ya and Ichibirian are a must to check-out, with Glico and Kuidaore Taro merchandise. I purchaded a yellow tin from Ichibirian. More so to collect the tin than for the delicious Kuidaore Taro shaped crackers inside. Be warned though that these shops are popular with young school children, even early in the day. The lines can wrap around the store.

For anyone with an interest in anime or manga, Mandarake Grand Chaos is a short walk from Dōtonbori. There are floors of comics, toys and collectibles. I was on the hunt for Yotsuba&!. The manga series depicts the adventures of a young girl as she grows up. It's a recommended choice for anyone learning Japanese. The book features a reading aid called furigana, which are small kana characters next to complex kanji.
