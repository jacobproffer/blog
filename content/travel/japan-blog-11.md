My interest with Osaka started with an action-adventure game called Yakuza 0. The game takes place in 1988 and is set in Tokyo's Kabukichō and Osaka's Dōtonbori. The attention to detail in the game is superb, especially with stores such as Don Quijote, stray cats and the canals of Dōtonbori. There's even a mission that spans the length of the Ebisu bridge in Osaka, where you help defend a teen from thugs.

That's where I began Friday in Japan, with a few hours in Dōtonbori. The area is around a mile from the Sarasa Hotel in Namba. But it's well within walking distance and easy to find. In the morning, cats walk freely among the canals. Workers clean-up trash while dozens of food stalls are set-up. It's also the time to check out the Glico Man sign and Ebisu bridge before the streets are filled with tourists.

Stores such as Glico-ya and Ichibirian are great for candy, snacks and Osaka related souvenirs. With a variety of merchandise, there are even Glico Man branded eye-shades and socks. A must have for me was a yellow tin from Ichibirian. More so for the tin than the delicious "Kuidaore Taro," shaped crackers inside. Be warned though that both stores are popular with young school children, even early in the day. The lines can wrap around the stores but it's worth the wait.

For lunch, I recommend to skip restaurants and try street food instead. One of the most common dishes is takoyaki, which is a ball-shaped snack with diced octopus. Most takoyaki food stalls range in price but it's never more than five hundred yen. There are also dangos, which are Japanese dumplings served on a skewer. I tried mitarashi dangos, which were doused with a sweet soy sauce. It was absolutely delicious. Both options can be found in a variety of locations around Dōtonbori.
