Tomorrow night, I leave for Romania. My friend Myles and I will be in Bucharest for a week. We have a few day trips planned, with the most extensive being a border crossing into Bulgaria. I honestly know little about Romania or Bulgaria but am excited nonetheless. I'll get to explore new cultures and be around more languages. I also get to fly a few new airlines, such as Air France.

Wish me luck.

On a side note, I am behind on posts. I hope to find time to catch up on a few more Japan and Japanese blog posts. October was a busy month. I hardly had enough time to study Japanese at a comfortable pace.
