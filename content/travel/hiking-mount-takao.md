After a full day of recovery and shopping in Akihabara, I traveled to Mount Takao. The mountain is located in the city of Hachiōji.

At Takaosanguchi Station, I stopped into an open air convenience store near the exit. There were coolers with water, electrolyte drinks, beer, aisles of snacks and Montbell hiking products. I spent five minutes admiring the Montbell hats but left the store with a lime green Montbell water bottle, sour candy, a bottle of water and a sports drink called Pocari Sweat. Since trashcans and recycle bins are hard to locate in Japan, I took a moment to pour the water into my water bottle outside of the shop.

At the base of Mount Takao, I had to make a decision on which trail to take to the summit. The Omotesando Trail, was the longest trail but the easiest choice as it was paved for nearly three miles. There were shorter trails, such as the Kasumidai Loop, which is a half mile in length. The Katsura Woods Trail, known as Trail 3, is a mile and a half in length. I chose the second longest trail, the Biwa Waterfall Trail, which is two miles long. The trail begins across a small foot bridge to the left of the chairlift.

The majority of the Biwa Waterfall Trail is dirt with large tree roots. Though, more than a hundred wooden steps are to be climbed along the way to the summit. I stopped every five to ten minutes to drink water or replenish electrolytes. Every time I stopped, the sounds of the wildlife and bugs were deafening. There were thousands of cicadas. I had never listened to the sound before. Each cicada made the same noise in a rhythmic pattern.

Distance to the summit was measured by wooden poles in the ground along the trail. The distance numbers had notes such as, "{{< japanese >}}二/三一{{< /japanese >}} KM" (Two out of thirty-one kilometers).
