After a full day of recovery and shopping in Akihabara, I hiked Mount Takao. The mountain is located in Tokyo, near the city of Hachiōji. To get there, I took a train from Akihabara Station to Shinjuku Station. From Shinjuku Station, I took another train to Takaosanguchi Station. The station was small, with two tracks. One track was for arrivals, the other for departures. I stopped into an open air convenience store near the exit of the station. There were coolers with water, electrolyte drinks, beer, aisles of snacks and Montbell hiking products. I left the store with a lime green Montbell water bottle, sour candy, a bottle of water and a sports drink called Pocari Sweat.

The base of Mount Takao was a short walk from Takaosanguchi Station. Along the path to the base camp, I passed shops and cafes. One of the shops was the Salomon Tokyo Takao Concept store, which used to be a house. At the base of Mount Takao, I had to make a decision on which trail to take to the summit. The Omotesando Trail, was the longest trail but the easiest choice as it was paved for nearly three miles. There were shorter trails, such as the Kasumidai Loop, which is a half mile in length. The Katsura Woods Trail, known as Trail 3, is a mile and a half in length. I chose the second longest trail, the Biwa Waterfall Trail, which is two miles long. The trail begins across a small foot bridge to the left of the chairlift.

The majority of the Biwa Waterfall Trail is dirt with a minefield of tree roots. Hundreds of wooden steps are to be climbed along the way to the summit. I stopped every five to ten minutes to drink water or replenish electrolytes. Every time I stopped, the sounds of wildlife and bugs were deafening. There were thousands of cicadas. I had never listened to the sound before. Each cicada made the same noise in a rhythmic pattern.

Distance to the summit was measured by wooden poles in the ground along the trail. The distance markers had notes such as, "{{< japanese >}}二/三一{{< /japanese >}} KM" (2 / 3.1 kilometers). I reached the south side of the summit after an hour of hiking. Views of distant hills and mountains were visible from the observation deck. Mount Fuji was barely visible from the summit, the top shrouded in clouds upon my arrival. I took photographs from the observation deck and walked to the small restaurant in the center of the summit. It was near lunch time and I was ready for a beer.

At the restaurant, I was seated at a short-legged chabudai table. I kept my shoes on but was required to sit cross-legged. I ordered sansai soba, which is a Japanese cold noodle dish with buckwheat noodles and sansai - a mix of wild mountain veggies. Admittedly, I did not enjoy the soba dish. The veggies were slimy and did not taste great on a humid Japanese summer day. I ate half of the bowl and finished my beer. Before I left, two Japanese children came to me with chaperones. The children were part of a school field trip and their goal was to interview foreigners in English. They asked where I was from, my age and what my favorite meal was. When I said tonkatsu, one of the children became excited. It was their favorite meal.

After I paid the bill, I descended Mount Takao via the Omotesando Trail, known as Trail 1. The path is paved and has shrines and shops along the way to the base of the mountain.
