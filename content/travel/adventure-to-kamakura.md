It took multiple trains to reach Kamakura from Akihabara, a seaside city to the south of Tokyo. It was more like a large town than a city, similar to Marquette, Michigan. Plenty of private homes, a sizable district to shop and multiple beaches. There were no skyscrapers or large structures. A single train track seemed to run through the city, which stopped traffic ever so often. The street traffic was light and was overall, a quiet place to visit.

From the station, I could not see the shoreline but used Google Maps to point myself in the direction of Yuigahama Beach. It's almost directly south of Kamakura Station. Along the way, I passed small gas stations, a fire station and a historical landmark called Ichi-no Torii. Near the landmark, I stopped at a vending machine to purchase a packet of chocolate chip cookies. I also bought a bottle of Pocari Sweat, an electrolytes drink unique to Japan. The taste reminded me of the Frost flavor of Gatorade.

Yuigahama Beach was mostly devoid of people when I arrived. The water was calm with a slight breeze. To the left, I could see a resort on the far side of the beach. Out on the water to my right, I spotted a lone kite surfer. A CH-47 Chinook flew over soon after, in a southern direction. Two ravens made their presence known soon after with a few croaks. I had yet to eat my cookies and it made me wonder if the birds somehow knew that. I probably should have not fed the birds but broke off a few pieces for each bird as I walked to west side of the beach.
