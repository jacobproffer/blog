It took multiple trains to reach Kamakura from Akihabara, a seaside city to the south of Tokyo. It was more like a large town than a city, similar to Marquette, Michigan. Plenty of private homes, a sizable district to shop and multiple beaches. There were no skyscrapers or large structures. A single train track seemed to run through the city, which stopped traffic ever so often. The street traffic was light and was overall, a quiet place to visit.

From the station, I could not see the shoreline but used Google Maps to point myself in the direction of Yuigahama Beach. It's almost directly south of Kamakura Station. Along the way, I passed small gas stations, a fire station and a historical landmark called Ichi-no Torii. Near the landmark, I stopped at a vending machine to purchase a packet of chocolate chip cookies. I also bought a bottle of Pocari Sweat, an electrolytes drink unique to Japan. The taste reminded me of the Frost flavor of Gatorade.
