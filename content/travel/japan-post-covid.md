Back in October of 2022, I booked a trip back to Japan when I saw the announcement that Japan was re-opening it's borders to tourists.

Once registered, the MySOS application checklist required a number of items to submit. Passport information and COVID-19 vaccination records were to be uploaded, along with photographs of both documents. Hotel contact information and general travel details were asked, along with a basic health questionnaire form to submit Once submitted, the application turned red. The Japan Airlines gate agent told me that the application review could take hours. So it was wise to submit it prior to flight, so that it would be reviewed by the time of arrival.

The flight to Narita went smooth with an okay movie selection. There were few hits, such as The Shawshank Redemption and Ford v Ferrari. Otherwise most of the films were foreign with limited subtitle availability. I ended up asleep most of the flight, unless food was served. Meals were made up of mostly salads, curry, rice, chicken and ice cream. I would have enjoyed a mixed drink along with the meals but was sober. A few days after the flight would mark one year without alcohol, so water or apple juice were the choices. Thankfully, there were no screaming babies. I had booked an aisle seat, so I was able to use the bathroom with ease.

The plane touched down in Narita around four in the afternoon on the twenty-second of October. It was a beautiful afternoon with blue skies. The deboard process was quick, though I forgot how long of a walk it was from the gate to the customs and immigration checkpoints. Somewhere along the way, I saw that the MySOS application on my phone had turned blue. This indicated that I was approved for entry, pending immigration and custom inspections. Towards the end of that long coordior, I was asked by an employee to scan the barcode within MySOS on a machine and then received an "all-access" pass. The pass basically just showed that I had passed the COVID-19 screening.
