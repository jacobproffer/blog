For the final day of my fourth trip to Japan, I intended to explore Lake Kawaguchiko. The itinerary included views of Mt. Fuji from Mt. Kachikachi, Tenjoyama Park, the Kawaguchiko Natural Living Center, and Ubuyagasaki Cape. Unfortunately, the weather forecast called for heavy rain throughout the entire region. As a fallback, with no plan, I visited the city of Yokohama for the first time. Located southwest of Tokyo, Yokohama is a port city, and is the capital of the Kanagawa Prefecture. From Akihabara Station, the city of Yokohama was located less than an hour away, a short train ride.

On arrival, I exited Yokohama Station and walked in the direction of a shopping center in a former warehouse known as Aka-Renga Soko. From the station, the brick warehouse was located a half hour away on foot. But what I had not anticipated were the multilane highways with limited street crosswalks in the area which surrounded Yokohama Station. Instead, the crosswalks were overhead, above ground. The overhead crosswalks sped-up the walk but lacked shade. The sun was high in the sky and the temperature was above ninety degrees fahrenheit.

I arrived two hours before Aka-Renga Soko was due to open. Aka-Renga Soko opens at eleven each morning, which gave me ample time to explore the area. The warehouse complex consisted of two elongated multi-story red brick buildings. Near the two structures, a sizeable white painted Shikishima-class patrol vessel of the Japanese Coast Guard was docked. Next to the ship, members of the Japanese Coast Guard conducted repelling training off of a high building. As commands were sternly yelled, I laid on a shaded bench in an open area of the property and took a nap.

When Aka-Renga Soko opened at eleven, I walked back-and-forth through the first floor dining options. There were a variety of fast food and upscale restaurants to choose from. I selected popcorn shrimp and ginger ale from a seafood restaurant called Kua Aina. Afterwards, I explored every store of both buildings in the shopping complex. A shop which stood out to me was Kissora, which sold a variety of leather gamaguchi wallets, pouches, and bags. For a good ten minutes, I debated a dark green coin wallet since I had plenty of change. Regrettably, I told myself no.
