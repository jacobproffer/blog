For the final day of my fourth trip to Japan, I intended to explore Lake Kawaguchiko. The itinerary included views of Mt. Fuji from Mt. Kachikachi, Tenjoyama Park, the Kawaguchiko Natural Living Center, and Ubuyagasaki Cape. Unfortunately, the weather forecast called for heavy rain throughout the entire region. As a fallback, with no plan, I visited the city of Yokohama for the first time. Located southwest of Tokyo, Yokohama is a port city, and is the capital of the Kanagawa Prefecture. From Akihabara Station, the city of Yokohama was a short train ride away, less than an hour.
