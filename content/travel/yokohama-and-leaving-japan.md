For the final day of my fourth trip to Japan, I intended to explore Lake Kawaguchiko. The itinerary included views of Mt. Fuji from Mt. Kachikachi, Tenjoyama Park, the Kawaguchiko Natural Living Center, and Ubuyagasaki Cape. Unfortunately, the weather forecast called for heavy rain throughout the entire region. As a fallback, with no plan, I visited the city of Yokohama for the first time. Located southwest of Tokyo, Yokohama is a port city, and is the capital of the Kanagawa Prefecture. From Akihabara Station, the city of Yokohama was located less than an hour away, a short train ride.

On arrival, I exited Yokohama Station and walked in the direction of a shopping center in a former warehouse known as Aka-Renga Soko. From the station, the brick warehouse was located a half hour away on foot. But what I had not anticipated were the multilane highways with limited street crosswalks in the area which surrounded Yokohama Station. Instead, the crosswalks were overhead, above ground. The overhead crosswalks sped-up the walk but lacked shade. The sun was high in the sky and the temperature was above ninety degrees fahrenheit.

The city of Yokohama was clean and quiet. There were no discarded cans of Strong Zero, or crumpled flyers for maid cafes. People walked in silence, with relaxed postures. Yokohama's Chinatown was no different, with the decorated streets devoid of any people in the early morning. I came across one open business, with fresh produce, fruits, and sweets displayed openly. The shop keeper greeted me and I paid 500 yen for a moon cake, which I had never had before. The outside of the cake was a hardened yolk, with a sweet paste in the center. Careful not to get crumbs on the ground, I ate the pastry on a nearby Coca-Cola bench.

I arrived at Aka-Renga Soko two hours before it was due to open. Aka-Renga Soko opens at eleven each morning, which gave me ample time to explore the area. The warehouse complex consisted of two elongated multi-story red brick buildings. Near the two structures, a sizeable white painted Shikishima-class patrol vessel of the Japanese Coast Guard was docked. Next to the ship, members of the Japanese Coast Guard conducted repelling training off of a high building. As commands were sternly yelled, I laid on a shaded bench in an open area of the property and took a nap.

When Aka-Renga Soko opened at eleven, I walked back-and-forth through the first floor dining options. There were a variety of fast food and upscale restaurants to choose from. I selected popcorn shrimp and ginger ale from a seafood restaurant called Kua Aina. Afterwards, I explored every store of both buildings in the shopping complex. A shop which stood out to me was Kissora, which sold a variety of leather gamaguchi wallets, pouches, and bags. For ten minutes, I debated a dark green coin wallet since I had plenty of change in my pocket. Regrettably, I told myself no.

When I left Kissora, I went to an upper floor of the building and exited onto an enclosed patio. Gray clouds had formed above the port, which brought wind to a humid day. Rain soon followed, which fell for twenty minutes. After the rain stopped, the sun returned and I left Aka-Renga Soko. Since I had no plans for Yokohama, I made the decision to return to Yokohama Station. Along way to the station, I came across a six floor mall called MARK IS Minatomirai. Initially, I went into the shopping center to pass through to the other side but the first floor stores intrigued me.

There were outlets for my favorite Japanese brands Montbell and Snow Peak. Beams, Marmot, The North Face, Oakley, amd Arc'teryx were nearby, though the Arc'teryx store had minimal product on-hand. Amongst these high brand stores was a pet store called Asahi Pets, with a variety of puppies and exotic birds. In the center of the lobby, near a Rolex store, a humongous Charizard card was roped off. The majority of the card was created through artificial flower petals. Black sand and wood chips were used to handle the text and background colors.

<!-- Leaving for Haneda -->
For no particular reason other than to be early, I arrived at the Haneda Airport seven hours before my flight. I was beyond early. The Delta ticket counter was not open, which provided plenty of time to explore the unsecured part of the terminal. With sliding doors and wooden exteriors, the shops and restaurants on the level above the ticket counters were themed in the style of traditional Japanese architecture. For breakfast, I ordered a burger with fries from a Mos Burger. I had never been to a Mos Burger before, but the food was good.
