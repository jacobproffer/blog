Myles and I stopped for lunch at the Snjófell Restaurant in Arnarstapi. The restaurant exuded an elegant atmosphere, which made me feel out of place in a neon red Arc'teryx jacket and headband. The place was empty upon arrival but filled with a tour group, comprised of older folks with binoculars hung on their necks. We both ordered lamb chops, priced at 4900 Icelandic Króna each. The meal was satisfying, with tender meat served alongside potatoes and a salad. After the meal, we lingered with cups of coffee before we left. The quiet atmosphere contrasted with the busyness outside, where the tour group prepared to move on to their next stop.

After lunch, we hiked from Arnarstapi to Hellnar along the coast. Aside from the persistent wind, the hike was peaceful, with no other people in sight. Myles and I stopped to photograph the rugged cliffs to capture the dramatic landscapes of the coastline. When we reached Hellnar, the village presented a quaint and charming scene, with small, colorful houses nestled against the backdrop of dramatic cliffs. We walked to the sea and encountered a mass of kelp. It was my first experience with kelp, and it was unpleasant with a horrible smell. Despite this, the view from Hellnar was beautiful, with a picturesque cove.
