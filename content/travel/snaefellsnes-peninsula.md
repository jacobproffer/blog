After an early breakfast, Myles and I set out towards the Snaefellsnes Peninsula in western Iceland. The lights of Reykjavik faded quickly as we left behind the bustle of the capital. The roads led us through landscapes which shifted from farmlands to desolate lava fields. As we approached the peninsula, jagged peaks and volcanic formations rose against the horizon. The route remained quiet, with scattered farmhouses, and small villages along the way. We stopped briefly at the Snaefellsnes Visitor Center to use the bathroom, where a payment system was in place but out of order. The facility featured an all-gender bathroom, which we had not encountered in Iceland before. After the brief stop, we continued our drive to the west along a quiet road surrounded by rugged terrain.

The first stop of the day was the Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge, a narrow fissure carved into a steep mountainside. Myles and I missed the turnoff initially as we drove by, noticing a cluster of parked vehicles below a slope of gravel, jagged rocks, and moss. Once we parked, we hiked a short trail to the gorge. Thick snow blanketed parts of the trail, and the melting ice made conditions dangerous to venture deeper into the gorge where the stream flowed from. Instead, I cross the stream to explore the opposite side, where I climbed a hill for a vantage point. From the elevated perch was a panoramic view of expansive terrain and distant mountain ranges.

Myles and I stopped for lunch at the Snjófell Restaurant in Arnarstapi. The restaurant exuded an elegant atmosphere, which made me feel out of place in a neon red Arc'teryx jacket and headband. The place was empty upon arrival but filled with a tour group, comprised of old folks with binoculars hung on their necks. We both ordered lamb chops, priced at 4900 Icelandic Króna each. The meal was satisfying, with tender meat served alongside potatoes and a salad. After the meal, we lingered with cups of coffee before we left. The quiet atmosphere contrasted with the busyness outside, where the tour group prepared to move on to their next stop.

After lunch, we hiked from Arnarstapi to Hellnar along the coast. Aside from the persistent wind, the hike was peaceful, with no other people in sight. Myles and I stopped to photograph the rugged cliffs to capture the dramatic landscapes of the coastline. When we reached Hellnar, the village presented a quaint and charming scene, with small, colorful houses nestled against the backdrop of dramatic cliffs. We walked to the sea and encountered a mass of kelp. It was my first experience with kelp, and it was unpleasant with a horrible smell. Despite this, the view from Hellnar was beautiful, with a picturesque cove.
