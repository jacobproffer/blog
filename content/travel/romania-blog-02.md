Pancakes and orange juice. That's how Myles and I started our first day in Bucharest, Romania. We had heard about the Grand Cafe Van Gogh prior to our trip and wanted to give it a try. Located within Old Town, the cafe is a mile from the Labirint Hotel. Their pancakes were thick and the orange juice freshly squeezed. Better yet, the prices were beyond reasonable. A fantastic way start to our morning.

The first location Myles and I visited after breakfast was Pasajul Victoria, a popular street in Old Town. Multicolored umbrellas are layered above the street, a real beautiful work of art. When Myles and I arrived to the sight, we encountered a couple in the middle of a dramatic photoshoot. The male posed in a number of positions while the female snapped away. Myles and I took a photograph of the umbrellas and moved on.
