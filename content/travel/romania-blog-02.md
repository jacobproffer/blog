Pancakes and orange juice. That's how Myles and I started our first day in Bucharest, Romania. We had heard about the Grand Cafe Van Gogh prior to our trip and wanted to give it a try. Located within Old Town, the cafe is a mile from the Labirint Hotel. Their pancakes were thick and the orange juice freshly squeezed. Better yet, the prices were beyond reasonable. A fantastic way start to our morning.
