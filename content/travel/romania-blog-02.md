Pancakes and orange juice. That's how Myles and I started our first day in Bucharest, Romania. We heard about the Grand Cafe Van Gogh prior to our trip and wanted to give it a try. Located within Old Town, the cafe is a mile from the Labirint Hotel. True to the name, there are a vast number of Van Gogh paintings throughout the restaurant. I doubt that they are real. Yet their pancakes were thick and the orange juice freshly squeezed. Better yet, the prices were beyond reasonable. A fantastic way start to our morning.

The first location Myles and I visited after breakfast was Pasajul Victoria, a popular street in Old Town. Multicolored umbrellas are layered above the street, a beautiful work of art. When Myles and I arrived to the sight, we encountered a couple in the middle of a dramatic photoshoot. The male posed in a number of positions while the female snapped away with a camera. Myles and I felt awkward amongst the couple, so we took a few photographs and left. We moved onto the Cărturești Carusel bookstore, passing the Stavropoleos Monastery along the way.\

The Cărturești Carusel bookstore is located in the heart of Old Town. Spanning six floors, the store is painted white with curved balconies and spiral staircases. There is a tea house on the top floor and a plethora of books to be found below it. There is even a basement level with movies, games and vinyl records. The majority of the books in the store are in Romanian but there are a number of titles in English. I was on the lookout for a miniature Romanian phrase book. I found a few phrase books on the second floor but none were in the size that I sought.
