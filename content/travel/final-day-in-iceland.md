The rain continued steadily on our final day, which casted a misty gray across southern Iceland. Myles and I spent the morning in Reykjavik, heading downtown for an early lunch. We made our way to Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur, a famous hot dog stand known for serving Iceland's best lamb hot dogs. The line stretched out from the small stand, a mix of locals on their lunch break and tourists eager to experience the famous dish.

When it was our turn, I ordered a small carton of chocolate Kókómjólk, or skimmed milk, and a lamb hot dog loaded with everything: Icelandic ketchup, mustard, raw onions, crispy fried onions, and Remolaði sauce. The first bite hit the spot with a blend of flavors and textures which came together in a way which was satisfying. Myles and I ate behind the stand, resting our food and drinks on a bar height table.

After lunch, Myles and I wandered through the nearby shops to pass the time. One store, 66 North, had a sleek blue shirt which caught my eye, but the high price tag convinced me to leave it behind. We ducked into a shop which sold Icewear apparel, where I bought souvenirs for friends and family. Our last stop was 12 Tónar, a legendary record store, where I bought an Icelandic jazz album. It was a fitting souvenir to remember the trip, which reminded of the rainy streets of Reykjavik.

## Erupting Volcano and a Lighthouse Cat in Garður

After leaving Reykjavik, we hit the road and headed towards the Reykjanes Peninsula. Near the highway, we were lucky to catch sight of the recently erupted volcano in the distance. A cluster of tourists had gathered at a safe viewport along the highway, with large camera lenses ready to capture the spectacle. Though it was miles away, the burts of lava were visible shooting into the air, bright against the dull sky.

Later in the afternoon, we drove to Garður, a small town at the northern tip of the peninsula known for lighthouses. As Myles and I wandered near one of the lighthouses, I was greeted by a friendly cat which came to me without hesitation. It wore a collar, and a mix of white, gray, and black. The cat rubbed against my legs and purred as if it had known me for years. After a long day of boredom, the interaction with this affectionate cat was a welcome moment of warm and calm.
