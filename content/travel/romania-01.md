Bucharest's primary airport, Henri Coandă International Airport, is a small but bustling transportation hub. Located ten miles from the city center, it is the only airport that serves scheduled passenger aircraft within the capital of Romania. I touched down late at night on the 5th of November. We deplaned on the tarmac and boarded a shuttle bus. The bus took the passengers and I to the terminal nearby. Once inside the terminal, I hustled to the immigration and customs station.

As I had been near the front of the aircraft, I was one of the first to arrive. A young agent took my passport and a boarding pass from Heathrow. Along with a superior, she went over my documents. After a short time, with no questions asked, she stamped my passport. I made a beeline to the lobby of the airport and found Myles. He had arrived in the afternoon and had been in the lobby ever since. I placed a call to the hotel to see if a shuttle was available. There wasn't.

Our only option was to take a taxi. Within the lobby of Henri Coandă, there is a ticket machine in the center. The user is able to choose the brand of taxi, along with seeing the rate per kilometer. Myles and I chose a taxi within the medium fare range. With the ticket printed, we exited the airport in search for our specific taxi. The ticket information was in Romanian but I was able to understand what the identification number of the taxi was. After a few minutes, Myles spotted our designated taxi. The driver, an older man, checked our ticket and put our backpacks in the trunk of his car.
