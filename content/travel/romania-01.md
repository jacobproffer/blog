I touched down at Henri Coandă International Airport, Bucharest's primary airport, late on the 5th of November. We deplaned on the tarmac and boarded a shuttle bus. The shuttle took the passengers and I to a terminal nearby. As I had been near the exit of the bus, I was one of the first to arrive at the immigration and customs station. A young agent took my passport and a boarding pass from Heathrow. Along with a superior, she went over my documents. After a short time, with no questions asked, she stamped my passport. I made a beeline to the lobby of the airport and found Myles. He had arrived in the afternoon and had been in the lobby ever since. I placed a call to the hotel to see if a shuttle was available. There wasn't. Our only option was to take a taxi. Within the lobby of Henri Coandă, Myles and I located a ticket machine for taxi cabs. We were able to choose the brand of taxi, along with seeing the rate per kilometer.

Myles and I chose a taxi within the medium fare range. With the ticket printed, we exited the airport in search for our specific taxi. The ticket information was in Romanian but I was able to understand what the identification number of the taxi was. After a few minutes, Myles spotted our designated taxi. The driver, an older man, checked our ticket and put our backpacks in the trunk of his car. He ushered us into the back of the taxi, turned on the rate meter and sped out of the airport. While driving down the highway, shifting gears constantly, the driver held a conversation on his phone.
