Bucharest's primary airport, Henri CoandÄƒ International Airport, is a small but bustling transportation hub. Located ten miles from the city center, it is the only airport that serves scheduled passenger aircraft within the capital of Romania. I touched down late at night on the 5th of November. We deplaned on the tarmac and boarded a shuttle bus. The bus took the passengers and I to the terminal nearby.

Once inside the terminal, I hustled to the immigration and customs station. The line wasn't too long yet, as I had been near the front of the aircraft. A young agent, a trainee, took my passport and boarding pass from Heathrow. Along with a superior, they went over my documents.
