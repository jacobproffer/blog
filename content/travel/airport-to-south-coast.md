<!-- Landing / leaving airport -->
As with my [latest trip to Japan]({{< ref "/travel/back-to-japan-again" >}}), the plane parked on the tarmac away from the terminal.

Once through immigration and customs, Myles and I went to pick-up the keys for the vehicle we rented. Through a company called Europcar, I reserved a Suzuki Jimny. Unfortunately, upon arrival, the Europcar worker said no automatic versions of the Jimny were available. Instead, Myles and I received a Mitsubishi Eclipse. It was not the same style of vehicle but it had an automatic transmission and four-wheel drive. After I signed for the vehicle, Myles and I left the airport to locate the vehicle in an adjacent lot. The SUV was new, and to my surprise, was a hybrid.

Unlike in [2018]({{< ref "/travel/iceland-blog-01" >}}), Myles and I were unable to take the scenic route along the coast to the south of the airport to reach Rejykvaik. Due to recent volcanic activity in the region, the town of Grindavik and nearby roads were closed off. The Blue Lagoon was open to the public but Myles and I skipped the lagoon as we had lost a complete day due to the flight delay. We took the highway into Rejykvaik, which was busier than I remembered from the past trip. Once at the hotel, our plan was to unpack, shower, and go straight out to Þingvellir National Park after we changed.
