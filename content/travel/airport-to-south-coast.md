With an early arrival into Keflavik, Myles and I arrived in Iceland at five in the morning. As with my [latest trip to Japan]({{< ref "/travel/back-to-japan-again" >}}), the plane, a Boeing 757, parked on the tarmac away from the terminal. Since there was no jet bridge, buses were required to reach a nearby terminal. I was in the rear of the plane, which meant I was on the last bus. Myles and I met in the arrival terminal, and waited together in line for the immigration checkpoint. The line moved faster than expected, and we were both through within minutes with fresh arrival stamps in our passports.

Once through customs, Myles and I went to pick-up the keys for the vehicle we rented. Through a company called Europcar, I reserved a Suzuki Jimny. Unfortunately, upon arrival, the Europcar worker said no automatic versions of the Jimny were available. Instead, Myles and I received a Mitsubishi Eclipse. It was not the same style of vehicle but it had an automatic transmission and four-wheel drive. After I signed for the vehicle, Myles and I left the airport to locate the vehicle in an adjacent lot. The SUV was new, and to my surprise, was a hybrid.

Unlike in [2018]({{< ref "/travel/iceland-blog-01" >}}), Myles and I were unable to take the scenic route along the coast to the south of the airport to reach Rejykvaik. Due to recent volcanic activity in the region, the town of Grindavik and nearby roads were closed off. The Blue Lagoon was open to the public but Myles and I skipped the lagoon as we had lost a complete day due to the flight delay. We took the highway into Rejykvaik, which was busier than I remembered from the past trip. Once at the hotel, our plan was to unpack, shower, and go straight out to Þingvellir National Park after we changed.

The hotel, Reykjavik Lights, was located on the eastern side of Rejykvaik. From the airport, the drive took forty minutes. Myles and I stayed at the hotel in 2018, and were familiar with the area. As Myles and I had paid for our rooms in advance, the check-in process was quick. Unfortunately, unlike the earlier stay, our rooms faced the opposite side of Rejykvaik. My view was of nearby buildings instead of Mount Esja. The room, however, was immaculate as before with a full-size couch and large bed. My favorite aspect of the room was the sizeable bathroom, which had a heated towel rack and a walk-in rainfall style shower.
