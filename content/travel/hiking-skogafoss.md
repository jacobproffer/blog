On the fourth day in Iceland, Myles and I ventured into Grái Kötturinn, a cozy cafe in downtown Reykjavik. Known as The Grey Cat, this hidden gem was a short drive from Reykjavik Lights, though finding parking downtown proved to be an adventure in itself. After weaving through side streets, we finally located a spot within walking distance and made our way to the cafe. The atmosphere of Grái Kötturinn is comparable to an old library. The dim lighting casted a soft glow along the wooden tables, while shelves lined with well-worn books added to the cozy atmosphere.

We slid into a corner bench, surrounded by plush stools, and browsed the menu for breakfast. At the counter, I ordered freshly squeezed orange juice, black coffee, and a large order of pancakes accompanied by crispy bacon.
