On the fourth day in Iceland, Myles and I ventured into Grái Kötturinn, a cozy cafe in downtown Reykjavik. Known as The Grey Cat, this hidden gem was a short drive from Reykjavik Lights, though finding parking downtown proved to be an adventure in itself. After weaving through side streets, we finally located a spot within walking distance and made our way to the cafe after paying a parking fee of 1,800 ISK.

The atmosphere of Grái Kötturinn is comparable to an old library. The dim lighting casted a soft glow along the wooden tables, while shelves lined with well-worn books added to the cozy atmosphere. We slid into a corner bench, surrounded by plush stools, and browsed the menu for breakfast. At the counter, I ordered freshly squeezed orange juice, black coffee, and a large order of pancakes accompanied by crispy bacon.

As the food arrived, I quickly learned large meant large at Grái Kötturinn. What I pictured in my head as normal-sized pancakes turned out to be a towering stack. The pancakes were fluffy and rich, soaked with maple syrup, which paired perfectly with the salty crunch of the bacon. Despite my best efforts, I managed to eat half of the enormous stack. Though the meal was expensive, and I did not finish the pancakes, it was one of those meals which made me regret nothing.
