Until this trip to Japan, I've never flown domestically within another country. I was unsure of what the process would be like. But it's the same as it is within the United States. After immigration and customs, I only had to go through security. Though I didn't realize until I was in the domestic terminal that I was not flying American Airlines to Osaka. I would fly Japan Airlines, which I had never flown before.

The airlines changed my seat last minute and I ended up in premium economy, right before business. I am unsure if it was an upgrade or to balance out the plane. In any case, the Boeing 787-9 is fantastic. My seat had a few buttons, which turned the chair into a recliner. There also was a slide out tablet, but I fell asleep quickly. I woke up a few minutes prior to touchdown at Osaka International Airport around eight at night.

After I deboarded the plane, I made my way to the monorail connected to the airport. It was my first taste of the subway system within Osaka. From Osaka International Airport, I took the monorail to Senri-Chūō Station. From that station, I purchased a ticket on another subway line to Namba Station. The whole process took around an hour, with stops at various stations along the way.
