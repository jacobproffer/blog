Back in October 2022, I booked a trip back to Tokyo when the Japanese government announced that it was re-openening its borders to tourists. It had been three years since I had flown but I was ready. In a span of two weeks, I planned out the trip and did a currency exchange through my local bank. As with any trip, I packed light. A simple 28-liter backpack with compression bags is all I travel with. The only addition was a small sling pouch to carry my passport and camera accessories.

The layout of Chicago's O'Hare airport is always the same. I walked from the G concourse to K through a food court, past security, down a corridor, past another food court, and finally reached the end of that wing of the airport. Most international flight gates are down here. I had arrived five hours early so my particular gate was still serving another flight upon arrival.

Japan Airlines staff eventually arrived at the gate with a cardboard cut-out of a Japan Airlines flight attendant. The cut-out had a sign that asked for all passengers to wear masks. I noticed that passengers without masks were handed masks by the gate agents. I checked in with one of the gate agents and was asked if I had already completed the MySOS application for entry into Japan. I had not. Fortunately, I had already downloaded the application onto my phone before I left home.

The MySOS application required a number of items to submit. Passport information and COVID-19 vaccination records were needed, along with photographs of both documents. Hotel contact information and travel details were asked, with a basic health questionnaire form to submit. The application turned red upon submission, which meant the information was ready to be reviewed. The gate agent told me that the application review could take hours to be completed. So it was wise to submit it prior to flight, so that it would be reviewed by the time of arrival in Japan.

The flight to Narita was smooth. There were few movies to watch, such as The Shawshank Redemption and Ford v Ferrari. Otherwise, most of the films were foreign with limited subtitle availability. I ended up asleep most of the flight, unless food was served. Meals options included salads, curry, rice, chicken and ice cream. I would have enjoyed a mixed drink along with the meals but was I was sober. A few days after the flight would mark one year without alcohol, so water or apple juice were my choices. Thankfully, there were no screaming babies.

The plane touched down in Narita around four in the afternoon on the twenty-second of October. The deboard process was quick, though I forgot how long of a walk it was from the gate to the customs and immigration checkpoints. Somewhere along the way, I saw that the MySOS application on my phone had turned blue. This indicated that I was approved for entry into Japan, after immigration and custom inspections. Towards the end of that long corridor, I was asked by an airport employee to scan the barcode within MySOS on a machine and then received an "all-access" pass. The pass basically just showed that I had passed the COVID-19 screening.

The customs and immigrations process was consistent with previous trips to Japan. Long lines, no questions and no issues. I exited the secured portion of the airport and was back in the lobby. I can remember the initial anxiety I had in this lobby when I first traveled to Japan in 2017. Over six thousand miles away from home, with no friends and not a clue what to do next. The fear was long gone on this third trip and I knew what to do. I located the escalator down to the lower level which housed a number of ticket counters for various train companies. I purchased an outgoing and return ticket with Skyliner. Though I was uncertain about the departure time on the return ticket. It was about two hours prior to my flight out of Japan. In retrospect, I shouldn't have accepted that time.

The train ride from the Narita airport to Tokyo Station was longer than I had remembered. It took over an hour to arrive. Thankfully, the Skyliner has comfortable seats. Similar to my trip in 2017, it was dark by the time the train had departed Narita, so I couldn't see much outside of the windows. From Tokyo Station, I purchased a ticket to go to Akihabara Station. These transfer tickets are much cheaper and easy to purchase from the automated ticket machines. The ride from Tokyo Station to Akihabara Station only cost me 140 yen or about one dollar.
