In the fall of 2024, I returned to Japan for the fifth time. Choosing Japan Airlines once again, I landed at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan, which I've found far more convenient than Narita. Completing the arrival paperwork during the flight made my journey through immigration and customs seamless. Once in the arrivals area, I picked up a Welcome Suica card near the Tokyo Monorail gates, loading it with 5,000 yen.
