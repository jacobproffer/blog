After a day of bad weather at Fuji-Q Highland, I boarded a train destined for the mountainous region of Hakone. Along with a standard fair ticket at Shinjuku Station, I was required to buy a reserved seat for a special service train called the Limited Express Romancecar. The Romancecar first brought me to Odawara Station, which is an hour away from Tokyo. At Odawara Station, the train paused to decouple before it continued onward for another hour to Hakone-Yumoto Station. Once at Hakone-Yumoto Station, I was quick to board the first bus I came across. I was uncertain where the bus was destined for but figured I'd learn along the way.

From Hakone-Yumoto Station, the bus went into the hills of Hakone. It was a narrow two-lane route, with hairpin turns, which required the bus to constantly decelerate on an incline. The bus stopped near hotels, shopping centers, and in the middle of nowhere. After a half hour, when Hakone-jinja was listed on the bus marquee, I pressed the button next to my seat to signal to the driver I was ready to get off at the next stop. The bus stopped a block away from the south shores of Lake Ashi. I walked across a crosswalk next to the bus stop and towards the port of Hakonemachi-ko.

The port, on arrival, was devoid of any boats or ships. The water was calm, with fishers on the docks. The Hakone-jinja Shrine was visible from the port, which stood out with red paint. I walked along the edge of the port until I came to a narrow footpath to the left of a two lane road behind the shrine. The path, shrouded in tall grass and foliage, brought me to the left side of the shrine. Although the shrine gave the impression it was empty from the viewpoint of the port, the trees hid the mass of people who awaited their individual turns to have their photo taken in front of the shrine. I took photos of the shrine and returned to the port.

<!-- Lunch -->
Once at Togendai, I had lunch at a restaurant on the second floor of the ropeway station. I had cooked sausages and a sweet peach drink. The restaurant had a great view of Lake Ashi.

<!-- Chairlift to Owakudani -->

<!-- Black eggs in Owakudani -->
I bought a pack of black eggs for 500 yen, which didn't taste different than ordinary hard boiled eggs.
