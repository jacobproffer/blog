I kicked off the second day with breakfast at Nadai Fuji Soba, a favorite diner of mine that is close to JR East Hotel Mets. One thousand yen was enough for tonkatsu with fried eggs over a hot bed of rice. It was a fifty percent increase of what the meal cost in October of 2022. But in all honesty, I would pay double. It's a delicious meal that is easy to eat with chopsticks. I did note that the diner had upgraded their order system since I had last visited. There was a new television screen that displayed which orders were ready and which ones were not.

Around ten, a seven floor department store called Radio Kaikan opened. It's one of my favorite places in Akihabara to kill time. There are a variety of gachapon re-sellers, card sellers, doll shops and model stores. Rarely do I make a purchase but I always browse the latest Zoids.

For dinner, I went back to Nadai Fuji Soba and had tonkatsu with fried eggs again. To help with the heat, I ordered a Suntory Lemon Sour. The drink had a fresh citrus flavor.
