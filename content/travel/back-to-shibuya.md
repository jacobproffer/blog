Shibuya always reminds me of Manhattan. Skyscrapers, busy streets, high-end shops and plenty of graffiti. I arrived at Shibuya Station early via the JR-East subway line. To get out of the light rain, I walked over to the Starbucks that's near the infamous Shibuya Scramble Crossing. The coffee shop offers a panoramic view of the crosswalk, although it can get busy. I had to sit at a back table for a few minutes before I found a spot near the window. A child behind me had a nasty cough, so I kept my mask on unless I wanted to take a sip of coffee.

Once the rain stopped, I walked outside to take photographs of the Shibuya Scramble Crossing. It is hard to grasp how large the crosswalk is unless you have walked across it. Once the cuckoo sound emits for the visually impaired, a sea of people from one side converge with another from the other side. Somehow, no one collides. It goes on all day long.

Afterward, I walked around various side streets and alleys to locate stores I wanted to visit that day. I mainly wanted to shop at Village Vanguard, Mandarake and Loft Shibuya. Village Vanguard in Shibuya was difficult to locate, as it is below ground. Google Maps had a weak signal in the city and I walked past the elevator multiple times. It amazed me how every alley was plastered with stickers and graffiti. The stickers covered nearly every surface, from phone booths to electrical units.
