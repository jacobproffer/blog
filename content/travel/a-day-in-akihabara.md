I would argue that Japan has the best variety and quality when it comes to vending machines. My first morning back in Akihabara started with a can of black coffee from one of the drink dispensers in an alley near the hotel. The upside was that the coffee was extremely hot. Most vending machines in Japan have options for both cold ({{< japanese >}}つめたい{{< /japanese >}}) and hot (あったかい) beverages. The same can be said for vending machines that offer soup or ramen. Most options are cheap too, some only 100 yen (Not even a dollar).

Unlike the United States, most stores in Japan do not open until around 11 a.m. or noon. I had left the hotel early, around eight a.m., so I had hours to wait. It was time to reorient myself with the layout of Akihabara. The one location that I remembered from my first trip was Matsumoto Kiyoshi. It's the largest drugstore chain in Japan and the storefront in Akihabara is hard to miss. The front side is bright yellow with blue trim. I decided it would be a landmark, since the hotel was nearly straight down the road in front of it.
