I would argue that Japan has the best variety and quality when it comes to vending machines. My first morning back in Akihabara started with a can of black coffee from one of the drink dispensers in an alley near the hotel. The upside was that the coffee was extremely hot. Most vending machines in Japan have options for both cold ({{< japanese >}}つめたい{{< /japanese >}}) and hot (あったかい) beverages. The same can be said for vending machines that offer soup or ramen.

Unlike in the United States, most stores in Japan do not open until around 11 a.m. or noon. Since it was still early, I had hours to wait. I decided to spend that time in an effort to refamiliarize myself with Akihabara.
