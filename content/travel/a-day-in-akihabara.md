I would argue that Japan has the best variety and quality when it comes to vending machines. My first morning back in Akihabara started with a can of black coffee from one of the drink dispensers in an alley near the hotel. The upside was that the coffee was extremely hot. Most vending machines in Japan have options for both cold ({{< japanese >}}つめたい{{< /japanese >}}) and hot (あったかい) beverages. The same can be said for vending machines that offer soup or ramen. Most options are cheap too, some only 100 yen (Not even a dollar).

Unlike the United States, most stores in Japan do not open until around 11 a.m. or noon. I had left the hotel early, so I had hours to wait. It was time to reorient myself with the layout of Akihabara. The one location that I remembered from my first trip was Matsumoto Kiyoshi. It's the largest drugstore chain in Japan and the storefront in Akihabara is hard to miss. The front side is bright yellow with blue trim. I decided it would be a landmark, since the hotel was nearly straight down the road in front of it.

For a few hours, I walked around various streets to the left and right of Matsumoto Kiyoshi. I mostly experimented with my Ricoh camera to ensure I remembered how to use it properly. Around noon, I had my first meal at a small diner near the hotel. I decided on curry with rice. To order the meal, I purchased a ticket through a machine outside the business. Once inside, I handed the ticket to a worker behind the kitchen counter and found an empty booth with a stool to sit on. Each booth had dividers on either side of it for privacy. While the food was prepared, I grabbed a cup of water and wooden chopsticks. Once I sat down, a man approached me with a number of yen coins. I had apparently forgotten to grab my change from the machine outside. I was surprised but appreciative at the generosity. I thanked the man multiple times in Japanese with a small bow before I grabbed my food from the counter.
