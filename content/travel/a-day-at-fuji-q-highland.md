After a day at Mount Takao, my plan was to hop on a train towards a national park called Hakone. A glance at the weather report revealed a forecast of heavy rain in the region throughout the day. I changed plans and went to Fuji-Q Highland instead, an amusement park located at the base of Mount Fuji, within the Yamanashi Prefecture of Japan. Before I left the hotel for Akihabara Station, I purchased a day pass for Fuji-Q Highland via an app called KKday on my phone. The e-ticket cost forty dollars and needed to be redeemed at the park entrance once I arrived.

From Akihabara Station, I took a train to Shinjuku Station and walked to the Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal. Via an automated ticket machine on an upper floor of the bus terminal, I purchased a one-way bus ticket to Fuji-Q Highland. The ticket cost 2,200 yen, which was half of the cost of a train ride towards Fuji-Q. After I purchased the ticket, I sat on an uncomfortable chair next to the assigned exit for my bus. Other buses came and went every five minutes to the same exit, which made me anxious.

The bus, a double decker, arrived on time. I was first to board, my seat located behind the driver on the first floor. There wasn't spacious leg room but the seat was comfortable. The bus driver took a good hour to exit the city limits of Tokyo. The endless rows of houses and structures of Tokyo faded behind as we passed through hills and distant mountains. On the highway, the bus was passed by Japanese Self Defense Force vehicles. There were olive drab Type-73 trucks with camouflaged soldiers seated on benches in the bed. Though I had been to Japan three times prior, it was my first time seeing the Japanese Self Defense Force.

My first ride of the day was Eejanaika, a fourth dimension hypercoaster with seats with the ability to rotate 360 degrees in a controlled spin. Mindful of long wait times at Fuji-Q Highland, I purchased an express pass for Eejanaika for 3,000 yen from an automated machine near a ride called Zokkon. The pass spared me from the prospect of a two-hour wait and gave permission to skip the standard line. The pass came with a catch - a limited time window. This caused for me to run from Zokkon to Eejanaika, a sizeable distance in the park. With the heat and high humidity of a Japanese summer, I was drenched in sweat upon arrival.

After I climbed the stairs to the top of Eejanaika, I was assigned the first car. Before I was allowed to board, shoes had to be removed and pockets emptied. Turn-key storage lockers were on the exit side of the ride. I was allowed to cross to the other side first and deposit my belongings. After I was seated, a worker secured me into the seat tightly with a shoulder harness and lap belt. The worker made me prove I wasn't able to remove the harness or belt, which soon made sense. After a lengthy climb, the coaster dove straight downward at high speed with an immediate climb. As the coaster went upside-down, my individual seat spun 360 degrees.
