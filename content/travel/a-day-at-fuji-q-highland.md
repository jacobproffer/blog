After a day at Mount Takao, my plan was to hop on a train towards a national park called Hakone. A glance at the weather report revealed a forecast of heavy rain in the region throughout the day. I changed plans and went to Fuji-Q Highland instead, an amusement park located at the base of Mount Fuji, within the Yamanashi Prefecture of Japan. Before I left the hotel for Akihabara Station, I purchased a day pass for Fuji-Q Highland via an app called KKday on my phone. The e-ticket cost forty dollars and needed to be redeemed at the park entrance once I arrived.
