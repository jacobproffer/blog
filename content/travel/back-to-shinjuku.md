On the fourth day of my third trip to Japan, I traveled back to Shinjuku from Akihabara Station. Shinjuku is one of the many special wards in Tokyo and is primarily a commercial and administrative hub. It is also home to Kabukicho, the infamous red light entertainment district. I stayed in the center of Kabukicho back in 2017 at the Hotel Gracery, which towers above TOHO Cinemas Shinjuku. In the five years since I had last visited, not much had changed. The only closure I noted was the Robot Restaurant.

I stopped by TOHO Cinemas to use the bathroom and saw that Deer Hunter (1978) was playing. With a run time of over three hours, I decided to purchase a ticket to kill some time before businesses opened. I happened to have purchased a ticket for a seat in-between two groups of people. Which meant that I had to step over multiple people in a darkened theater while I excused myself. It was awkward but I thought it was unique to be able to watch Deer Hunter in Tokyo.
