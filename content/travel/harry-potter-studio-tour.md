Hungover, I left the hotel in the morning for the Yushukan Museum. The museum is rumored to be owned by a far-right company, with exhibits and information in favor of Imperial Japan. Whether in favor or not, I was interested in the military aircraft and vehicles on display throughout the museum. Located in the Chiyoda ward of Tokyo, the museum was a short ride from Akihabara Station. I arrived before the museum opened, but was able to view the shrines and memorials throughout the museum property. A notable shrine was Yasukuni Jinja, which is in dedication to those who died in service for Japan. The shrine is controversial because the shrine was a symbol of dedication to Emperor Sh≈çwa throughout World War II.

Entrance to the Yushukan Museum cost 800 yen, which I paid at an automatic machine near the main entrance. The lobby had an immaculate A6M Zero fighter plane, a small restaurant and an open floor gift shop. No music played, nor did I hear any voices. Staff members worked in silence, their uniforms pressed and their gestures honed. Asides from the museum staff, I was the sole guest in the museum. The first exhibits were on the second floor, which were accessible after I scanned my ticket on a sensor and took an escalator to the upper deck.

The exhibits on the second floor covered the conflicts the Imperial Japanese Army took part in. In chronological order, each display provided a brief history of a conflict in Japanese and English. Swords, armor, uniforms, and firearms were displayed nearby the placards of text. A small theater played documentaries in Japanese related to the Yushukan Shrine and modern-day Japan. Throughout these enclosed exhibitions and theater, photographs were not allowed. Towards the end of the second floor, I took a stairwell to the first floor with an open floor World War II exhibition.
