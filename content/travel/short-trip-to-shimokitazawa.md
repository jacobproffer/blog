For breakfast, I stopped into the Brooklyn Roasting Company. The cafe is located near the Mikan Shimokita complex and stands out amongst nearby businesses with an off-white exterior that reminded me of a shipping container. The front side of the cafe has, "Brooklyn," painted across the structure in an earth-tone palette. I ordered a bacon lettuce tomato sandwich on white bread with a glass of orange juice.
