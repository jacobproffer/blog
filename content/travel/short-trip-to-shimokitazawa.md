The first half of my final day in Japan was spent in a thrifty cultural district called Shimokitazawa. The area is mostly known for secondhand and vintage fashion but also has a great number of cafes and theaters. It is located in Setagaya, another special ward of Tokyo. From Akihabara Station, the train ride was under an hour to Shimokitazawa Station with a cost of only 350 yen. Similar to Kamakura Station, Shimokitazawa Station is small in size. There are only six tracks, operated by two private railroad companies, with four of the tracks located below ground.

It was still early when I arrived at Shimokitazawa Station but it was a sunny day with blue skies. I walked over to the Brooklyn Roasting Company, a cafe that is a located near a complex called Mikan Shimokita. The cafe stands out amongst nearby businesses with an off-white exterior that reminded me of a shipping container. The front side of the cafe has, "Brooklyn," painted across the structure in an earth-tone palette. I ordered a bacon lettuce tomato sandwich on white bread with a glass of orange juice.

Afterwards, I walked around the business district of Shimokitazawa in a large circle until the shops started to open. There were a few businesses I wanted to check out, which included the Toyo Department Store. The store is technically six different stores in one, with a range of vintage clothes and jewelry. There were a few hip-hop related shirts that I was interested in but decided to pass due to the higher prices. Next, I walked over to Shimokitazawa's Village Vanguard. It's similar in size in comparison to the Shibuya location and contains most of the same merchandise. I spent most of my time in the manga section and was surprised that I was able to find the first omnibus for I Am a Hero in Japanese.

The only other notable shop that I stopped into was a bookstore called Tsutaya. It was a sizable bookstore with a lounge that also had the largest manga selection in Shimokitazawa. I browsed the shelves for awhile until I spotted the first entry of The Fable, a manga about a legendary hitman. I had recently watched the two movies on Netflix for The Fable, so I thought it could be a good manga to switch to after I Am a Hero. I purchased the manga and decided to return to Shimokitazawa Station to buy a return ticket to Akihabara. It was only noon but I wanted to have enough time to do another pass through Akihabara after I packed.
