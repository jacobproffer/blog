The final day of my third trip to Japan was not well planned. I only had a location in mind, a thrifty cultural district called Shimokitazawa. The area is mostly known for secondhand and vintage fashion but also has a great number of cafes. It is located in Setagaya, another special ward of Tokyo. From Akihabara Station, the train ride was under an hour to Shimokitazawa Station with a cost of 350 yen.

After I arrived, I walked from Shimokitazawa Station to the Brooklyn Roasting Company. The cafe is located near a complex called Mikan Shimokita and stands out amongst nearby businesses with an off-white exterior that reminded me of a shipping container. The front side of the cafe has, "Brooklyn," painted across the structure in an earth-tone palette. I ordered a bacon lettuce tomato sandwich on white bread with a glass of orange juice.

Shimokitazawa also has a Village Vanguard, which is similar in size in comparison to the Shibuya location. I spent most of my time in the manga section and was shocked that I was able to find the first omnibus for I Am a Hero in Japanese. When compared to the English version, the Japanese edition is thinner but the artwork is still the same.

Afterwards, I walked over to a bookstore called Tsutaya. which had the largest manga selection in Shimokitazawa. I browsed the shelves for awhile and finally chose the first entry of The Fable, a manga about a legendary hitman. I had recently watched the two movies on Netflix for The Fable, so I thought it could be a good manga to switch to after I Am a Hero.
