Before Myles and I departed for the south coast of Iceland, we had breakfast in the lobby of Reykjavik Lights. The dining area was beyond the bar, in a part of the hotel with no windows. There were rows of white tables with white chairs, next to a white table which held fresh cantaloupe, grapes, oranges, and watermelon on white plates. Warm bread was placed alongside peanut butter and Nutella. Sweets were nearby the bread, with a tower of muffins, croissants, cookies, and donut holes. Self-serve containers of coffee, tea, orange juice, cereal, and milk were behind the table of food, with a pot of hot oatmeal.

The first attraction for the day was Seljalandsfoss, a waterfall located seventy-seven miles to the south east of the Reykjavik. On the way out of the city, Myles and I stopped at an N1 gas station along the highway. Visually, gas stations in Iceland are no different than in the United States. There were rows of fuel pumps, which accepted credit cards. Inside the station, coolers were stocked with soda, energy drinks, electrolytes, and cold coffee. Snacks were neatly arranged in aisles. A favorite of mine was a fruit sticks from a brand called Castus. The price of fuel, however, was nearly three dollars a liter, which pushed the price per gallon past ten dollars. In total, I spent one hundred dollars to fill the tank.

From the N1 gas station, Myles and I stayed on Route 41 until we connected with Route 1, or the Ring Road. The Ring Road, as the name implies, circles the entire country of Iceland. Past the town of Hveragerði, which is near the [Reykjadalur Valley]({{< ref "/travel/hiking-thingvellir-and-reykjadalur-valley" >}}), Route 1 snakes through rural farms, nestled below snowcapped mountains and volcanos. Alongside the slopes were loose rocks and boulders the size of school buses. Sheep were everywhere, behind dug trenches and side by side with the road. The North Atlantic was nearly visible from the passenger side, beyond plains of nothingness.

Eastward on Route 1, Seljalandsfoss is visible from afar. The waterfall plunges two hundred feet from a cliff, and is served water from the Seljalands river, a side-effect of the melting glacier Eyjafjallajökull. Myles and I parked near a gift shop in the style of a cabin. As we had circled behind [Seljalandsfoss in 2018]({{< ref "/travel/iceland-blog-02" >}}), we walked a half mile to the north to visit Gljúfrabúi. The waterfall is overlooked, tucked into a wet cleft along the same rock face of Seljalandsfoss. Inside the canyon, in front of Gljúfrabúi, is a climbable boulder. Myles took a photograph of me atop the boulder in an upward angle, which exposed the 131 foot cliff.
