Before Myles and I departed for the south coast of Iceland, we had breakfast in the lobby of Reykjavik Lights. The dining area was beyond the bar, in a part of the hotel with no windows. There were rows of white tables with white chairs, next to a white table which held fresh cantaloupe, grapes, oranges, and watermelon on white plates. Warm bread was placed alongside peanut butter and Nutella. Sweets were nearby the bread, with a tower of muffins, croissants, cookies, and donut holes. Self-serve containers of coffee, tea, orange juice, cereal, and milk were behind the table of food, with a pot of hot oatmeal.

The first attraction for the day was Seljalandsfoss, a waterfall located seventy-seven miles to the south east of the Reykjavik. On the way out of the city, Myles and I stopped at an N1 gas station along the highway. Gas stations in Iceland are no different than in the United States. There were rows of fuel pumps, which accepted credit cards. Inside the station, there were coolers of beverages, hot coffee, and bites to eat. The price of fuel, however, was nearly three dollars a liter, which pushed the price per gallon past ten dollars. In total, I spent one hundred dollars to fill the tank.
