The rain continued steadily on our final day, which casted a misty gray across southern Iceland. Myles and I spent the morning in Reykjavik, heading downtown for an early lunch. We made our way to Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur, a famous hot dog stand known for serving Iceland's best lamb hot dogs. The line stretched out from the small stand, a mix of locals on their lunch break and tourists eager to experience the famous dish.

When it was our turn, I ordered a small carton of chocolate Kókómjólk, or skimmed milk, and a lamb hot dog loaded with everything: Icelandic ketchup, mustard, raw onions, crispy fried onions, and Remolaði sauce. The first bite hit the spot with a blend of flavors and textures which came together in a way which was satisfying. Myles and I ate behind the stand, resting our food and drinks on a bar height table.

After lunch, Myles and I wandered through the nearby shops to pass the time. One store, 66 North, had a sleek blue shirt which caught my eye, but the high price tag convinced me to leave it behind. We ducked into a shop which sold Icewear apparel, where I bought souvenirs for friends and family. Our last stop was 12 Tónar, a legendary record store, where I bought an Icelandic jazz album. It was a fitting souvenir to remember the trip, which reminded of the rainy streets of Reykjavik.

## Erupting Volcano and a Lighthouse Cat in Garður

After leaving Reykjavik, we hit the road and headed towards the Reykjanes Peninsula. Near the highway, we were lucky to catch sight of the recently erupted volcano in the distance. A cluster of tourists had gathered at a safe viewport along the highway, with large camera lenses ready to capture the spectacle. Though it was miles away, the bursts of lava were visible shooting into the air, bright against the dull sky.

Later in the afternoon, we drove to Garður, a small town at the northern tip of the peninsula known for lighthouses. As Myles and I wandered near one of the lighthouses, I was greeted by a friendly cat which came to me without hesitation. It wore a collar, and a mix of white, brown, and black. The cat rubbed against my legs and purred as if it had known me for years. After a long day of boredom, the interaction with this affectionate cat was a welcome moment of warm and calm.

As the day came to an end, Myles and I went to a nearby restaurant called Nings, where we enjoyed a quiet meal, reflecting on the experience of the trip. We pondered a movie at the theater for one last Iceland experience, but instead returned to the hotel to pack. Asides from the bad weather of the final two days, the trip had been full of unforgettable sights, both new and old. With everything packed and ready for an early morning flight, I was ready for bed. It was time to go home.

## Leaving Iceland

In the early hours of the morning, Myles and I checked out of the hotel and made our way to the airport. We navigated the quiet, rain-soaked streets one last time. Returning the rental car turned out to be unexpectedly confusing. A random employee took our keys, and drove the car away without any paperwork or formalities. We shrugged it off and walked from the drop-off point to the terminal. Once inside, I made a quick stop at the duty-free counter to reclaim taxes fo the hoodie I bought.

Before Myles and I went to our assigned gate, I bought one last lamb hot dog from a Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur outlet. Not the best breakfast meal but it filled my stomach for the morning. Boarding the flight, however, turned out to be the strangest part of the departure process. Unlike a traditional airport gate, we were herded toward a door where we waited in line, eventually boarding a series of buses which took us to a plane out on the tarmac. It took three or four buses to fill the plane.
