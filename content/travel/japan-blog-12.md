On a cold day this past spring, I visited Universal Studios Japan. I was initially hesitant to go, due to the high winds. But I wanted to stick to my itinerary. The rest of my trip was planned, so it was the only day that I could go. I arrived at the gates early in the morning, after a train ride from Namba. A single, general admission ticket cost me around 6,800 yen.

I had never been to Universal Studios before, so it was a completely new experience for me to walk through the park.
