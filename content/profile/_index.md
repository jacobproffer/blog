description: About Jacob Proffer.

Born and raised in Upper Michigan, I'm a certified Yooper situated in Marquette, Michigan. For the past four years, I've worked as a frontend-developer at a creative agency called Elegant Seagulls. By day, I code websites and at night, I study Japanese. When possible, I travel abroad. This blog is dedicated to those two topics.
