In the fall of 2003, I saw RuneScape for first time at a friends house. His character was at the Black Knights' Fortress. That very night, I went home and made my first account.

## First Rare and Lessons Learned

Through flipping and trading, I purchased my first rare item in late 2003, a Red hallowe'en mask. It was a prized item and I was proud to show it off. I wore it everywhere I went in the game, even to places I shouldn't. As a low level player at the time, I was unfamiliar with Karamja and the North Brimhaven mine. Upon arrival, I was attacked by poisonous scorpions. I was able to move out of the area but my character had been poisoned. Far from a bank and without Antipoison, I knew my character would die. My Red hallowe'en mask, along with other possessions, would soon drop to the ground. In a panic, I logged off and made a phone call to the friend who had introduced me to the game. I begged him to travel to the island in preparation. Thankfully, he agreed. We timed it perfectly. Upon login, my character died but my friend was ready to grab the mask and the other items from the ground.

From 2004 until 2005, quests and skills were put aside as I gained rapid typing skills in Falador Park. I would stay up all night to trade, constantly typing the same trade advertisements repeatedly. I can remember being at a friends house with a laptop, long after everyone went to bed, trading until the sun came up. I was focused on making money, not satisfied until I was able to purchase a party hat. To this day, I cannot remember which color I purchased first. But, I have printed screenshots of yellow and green party hats. My enjoyment of these items, however, would not last long.

In the summer of 2005, prior to the release of the bank pin system, my account was compromised. I can remember logging in at Castle Wars, only to find my character to be wearing a quest item, a gold helmet from a question called Between a Rock. I immediately checked my bank, only to find that all of my rare items, including gold, were gone. I had spent the better part of two years trading to acquire that wealth and bad password security was an easy downfall. On a yellow school folder where I kept printed screenshots of RuneScape, I wrote, "Retired". I even taped a screenshot onto the folder of my character holding a Fixed Device, from Mourning's End Part I, with the caption, "The end of RuneScape". I had decided to quit the game.

That lasted a few days. I changed my password, logged back on, re-checked my bank and found a black cavalier. The black cavalier was by no means an expensive rare at the time but it was worth a sizeable amount of gold in 2005. Since it was a fairly new item, I assume that the person who had compromised my account did not know what it was. I sold the item and re-bought all of my rune armor and dragon weapons that had been taken. That allowed for me to get back into quests and PVM content. Though my playtime per week dropped drastically for the next few years. Generally, I would only log-in for holiday events.

## First 99

In early summer of 2009, Woodcutting became a favored skill. It was relaxing and required minimal input. The magic trees at the Sorcerer's Tower near Seer's Village was the place to be as a woodcutter. The tower seemed to have it's own social community. A constant question was asked, "Woodcutting level?". It was a great place to kill time and have random conversations. The anti-macro or random events at the time provided a comedic relief. One of my favorites was the Strange Plant. If a player did not pick the fruit once it was fully grown, the plant would attack the player. It was common for many players to be away for the keyboard for too long and die.

Around September of that year, I got serious about achieving level 99 Woodcutting. Although I enjoyed the community at the Sorcerer's Tower, I transferred over to cutting Ivy on the walls of Varrock Palace. I received no money in return but the experience per hour went up greatly in comparison to magic logs. There was less conversation to be had but by the end of fall, I achieved my first 99. I can remember hitting the last few chunks of experience points back at the Sorcerer's Tower while everyone spammed the chat with congratulation messages. It was the first time I was able to purchase a skillcape, also known as a Cape of Accomplishment.

## 200M Archaeology

## 200M Thieving

Thieving was a skill I forgot about for years. I rarely trained it, unless needed for a quest. When it came time to tackle 99 Thieving, I was surprised to learn about safe cracking. The experience rate per hour, even with basic safes, was incredible. At level 90, I spent most nights at the Rogues' Castle in the Wilderness. With active safe cracking, the experience rate was above 500,000 experience per hour without bonus experience or double experience. Player killing in the Wilderness was uncommon at the time but I did have to hop worlds every now and then.

Once level 99 was achieved, the skill was technically finished. I had nothing else to unlock for the skill. But with the experience rates in mind, Thieving seemed to be an easy skill to level to virtual level 120. To speed up the process, I wanted to have access to the additional hidden safes in Zemouregal's fort, along with the Glacor Cave teleportation. This opened up a can of worms though, with a great number of quests required to be completed first. I can remember thinking I was finished multiple times, only to discover another requirement. But overall, I would say the quests were worth doing since the experience rate per hour was around one million afterwards.

Around the time I achieved virtual level 120, the Wilderness Rework had been implemented into the game. The project effectively removed threats from the Wilderness, which meant I could crack safes at the Rogues' Castle without concern. I decided to push forward to 200 million experience points in Thieving, the maximum amount of points for any skill in the game. I wouldn't receive any reward for doing so but my position on the high scores would be permanent. It took a little longer than I had hoped, due to a Wilderness safe reset timer increase that randomly came with an update to the Wilderness. But overall, it was not a horrible endeavour. I ended up receiving the Thieving pet, Ralph, around 180 million experience. My position as of this writing is 9,239 for Thieving.
