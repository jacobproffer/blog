Twenty years ago, in the fall of 2003, my RuneScape character arrived on Tutorial Island. At twelve years old, I had no clue that I had begun a journey that would carry on into my thirties. With nearly 5,000 hours played, I've slayed Elvarg the dragon, been welcomed into the Heroes' Guild, and earned the cape of legends. I've gained over a billion experience points, a virtual total level of 3,000 and maxed two skills to 200 million experience. Wealth has been earned, lost and stolen. Many friendships made and ended. Two decades of adventure in the realm of RuneScape, a virtual world that will forever hold a special place in my heart, have shaped me into the player and person I am today.

## Account Creation

In October of 2003, I recall the moment my friend Cody was engrossed in the midst of the Black Knights' Fortress quest. It marked my introduction to the world of RuneScape. It wasn't long before I created my inaugural character, Snoopde. However, the escapades of Snoopde were short-lived. In a matter of days, the account was locked. The reason behind this was a jest gone awry; I had typed into the chat that the account was up for sale near a bank in Varrock, which promptly led to a permanent account ban. Consequently, I embarked on a new journey with Snoopde2, the account that I continue to play to this day.

RuneScape quickly became an escape. Hours were spent engrossed with quests, skills, and trading. My engagement with the game increased further after my mother upgraded the account to membership, which unlocked more content for the game. One of my first acts as a member was the purchase of all gnome robes from Fine Fashions in the Grand Tree. There were a variety of colors to choose from, which was a cheap  fashion option for players with no money. Though membership also unlocked new risks.

Within the quest Fight Arena, I unwittingly stepped into the arena with General Khazard without teleportation runes. I was unprepared for the fight and my character was quickly killed. A hard lesson, as my items were dropped to the ground. Though by January of 2004, I had gained better knowledge of combat in RuneScape and took on a challenge for an early player, the Dragon Slayer quest. The quests completion provided the ability to wield the Rune Plate Mail Body, the strongest melee armor.

## Early Rares

I purchased my first rare item in early 2004, a Red hallowe'en mask. I wore it everywhere I went in the game, even to places considered dangerous. As a low level player, I was unfamiliar with Karamja and the North Brimhaven mine. Upon arrival, I was attacked by poisonous scorpions. Far from a bank and without Antipoison, my character would soon die. The Red hallowe'en mask, along with my other possessions, would drop to the ground. In a panic, I logged off and made a phone call to Cody. I begged for help. Thankfully, he agreed. Upon login, my character died but he was was there to grab the mask and the other items from the ground.

It was around this time that the RuneScape 2 beta was released, which delivered a massive update to the game engine. 2D sprites, which RuneScape was known for, were replaced with 3D models. In this process, a number of items became unobtainable. One of these items was the war ship, an item once found in Glough's house in the Gnome Stronghold, during the Grand Tree quest. The only way to acquire it was by transferring it from your Classic account when RuneScape 2 first came out. Because of this, the war ship became one of the rarest items in the game. And since I was hoarder, I still have one in my bank. I keep it next to a sole burnt swordfish, which I've also kept in my bank since 2003.

## End of RuneScape

For the next year, quests and skills were ignored as I spent hundreds of hours in Falador Park. With wavy chat effects, I would repeatedly advertise trade and sell offers, sometimes without sleep. I can remember being at a friends house with a laptop, long after everyone went to bed, trading until the sun came up. I was focused on making enough gold to purchase a party hat. I cannot remember which color I purchased first, though I have printed screenshots of yellow and white party hats. My enjoyment of these items, however, would not last.

{{< image src="/images/party-hats.jpg" alt="" >}}

In the summer of 2005, prior to the release of the bank pin system, my account was compromised. I logged in at Castle Wars, only to find my character to be wearing a quest item, a gold helmet from a quest called Between a Rock. I immediately checked my bank, only to find that all of my rare items, including gold, were gone. I had spent the better part of two years trading to acquire that wealth and bad password security was an easy downfall. On a yellow school folder where I kept printed screenshots of RuneScape, I wrote, "Retired". I even taped a screenshot onto the folder of my character holding a Fixed Device, from Mourning's End Part I, with the caption, "End of RuneScape". I decided to quit the game.

{{< image src="/images/end-of-runescape.jpg" alt="" >}}

That lasted a few days. I changed my password, logged back on, and found a Black Cavalier in my bank. By no means an expensive item at the time, the Black Cavalier was still worth a sizeable amount of gold in 2005. Since it was a fairly new item, I assume that the person who had compromised my account did not know what it was. I sold the item and re-bought all of my rune armor and dragon weapons that had been taken. That allowed for me to get back into quests and PVM content. Though my playtime per week dropped drastically for four years.

## First 99

In 2009, Woodcutting brought me back to the RuneScape. The skill was simple and required minimal input. The magic trees at the Sorcerer's Tower near Seer's Village was a favored spot. The tower had it's own social community. It was a great place to kill time and chat with other players. The anti-macro or random events provided comedic relief. One of my favorites was the Strange Plant. If a player failed to pick the fruit once it was fully grown, the plant would attack the player. It was common for many players to be away for the keyboard for too long and die. The Ent event, however, could be an annoyance. If your axe head broke off, you had to fetch it and travel to Bob's Axe shop in Lumbridge to fix it.

Level 99 Woodcutting, the maximum level of the skill, became a possible goal in September of that year. Although I enjoyed the Sorcerer's Tower, a faster Woodcutting method had been released into the game, Ivy. I received no money in return but the experience per hour went up greatly in comparison to cutting Magic Logs. There was less conversation to be had along the walls of Falador or Varrock Palace but by the end of fall, I achieved my first 99. The last few chunks of experience points were gained back at the Sorcerer's Tower. It was the first time I was able to purchase a skillcape, also known as a Cape of Accomplishment.

## Second 99

From the fall of 2010 until the summer of 2014, RuneScape was mostly forgotten. College was a priority, though I returned for the yearly Halloween and Christmas events. Deathcon II, the 2011 Halloween event, was memorable. Players were required to aid Death in preparing the Grim Reaper's Citadel for a convention. One of the rewards for the event was a Deathcon t-shirt, which I've worn each Halloween since. I also participated in the Combat Beta in 2012, which introduced a revamped combat system, adding abilities and a greater emphasis on strategy in battle.

The Combat Beta was mainly a preview of what RuneScape 3 would deliver to RuneScape, which was rolled out in full in 2013. One of the most notable improvements was the introduction of a modern HTML 5 game engine, instead of the traditional Java-based client that Jagex had always used. The updated game engine resulted in enhanced graphics and improved performance. Microtransactions were also embraced with the introduction of the Squeal of Fortune and Solomon's General Store. Bonds as well were available for purchase, which could be sold for in-game currency.

When I graduated college in the summer of 2014, I returned to this new version of RuneScape with the goal to reach level 99 Firemaking. I primarily chose this goal because the skill went along with Woodcutting, my first 99. It was through a clan I had joined that I learned of an efficient training method for Firemaking, which consisted of burning curly roots from the Jadinko Lair. These roots burned longer and awarded more experience than any other source of fire in the game at the time.

I spent the remainder of that summer within the Jadinko Lair while I watched horror movies such as the 1978 classic Piranha. I had re-arranged my desk to face the television in my room, which helped pass the time burning curly roots. Elaine, one of the clan members who had been helpful throughout my return RuneScape, met me near the Seer's Village bank for the last thousand or so experience points.

## Path to Max

Dungeoneering as a skill doesn't make sense to me. Although it requires strategy, it's vastly different in my opinion when compared to skills such as Crafting or Prayer. Dungeoneering requires the utilization of other skills, combat and the completion of puzzles. It's more of a drawn out mini-game, which is why I've always found the skill to be an annoyance to train. The Dungeoneering hole, released in 2019, was my lazy way to reach level 99. It requires minimal engagement, and it did not take a long time to level from 85 to 99 through the activity at the annual Beach event.

My last skill to level to 99 before the release of Necromancy in 2023 was Invention. It was initially slow to level because I had already maxed all of my combat skills prior to the skills release. I ended up leveling the skill through Fishing, Archaeology, and Mining as I worked towards 99 in those skills.

## First 120

Farming was my lowest skill in RuneScape for many years. The skill was passive upon release in 2005, and required a great deal of time and patience. There were limited training options and lower experience rates compared to today. Even in 2014, nine years after the release of the skill, my Farming level was only 53. The release of the Player-Owned Farm in 2018 brought a significant change to Farming. The activity introduced more engaging and interactive ways to train Farming. Players could breed and raise a variety of animals, which offered more dynamic gameplay. Most importantly, the Player-Owned Farm offered better experience per hour. This motivated me to engage with Farming more actively.

Though I did make use of tree patches in RuneScape as well, for regular and fruit trees, which provided large amounts of experience when fully grown. In addition, trees offered valuable resources, such as logs and fruit. The diversity of tree types, from willow to carambola trees, allowed players to tailor their skilling methods to their specific needs and goals. Though I only focused on magic trees after level 75 and the highest level fruit tree I had unlocked. With tree runs and the Player-Owned Farm activity, my Farming experience per week increased exponentially.

When I made the decision to pursue Farming as my first 120 level skill, I continued the methods that I had utilized to reach level 99. I conducted daily magic tree runs, at least one fruit tree run per day, and always had ten Black Dragons in the three large pens at the regular Player Owned Farm. On top of those primarily three methods, I would also have salamanders and various dinosaurs in pens at the Ranch Out of Time on Anachronia. It was a system that delivered high rates of experience per week, within the millions. Though, it still took over three months of patience and daily routine for me to reach level 120 from level 99.

### 200M Archaeology

Archaeology was my second 120 skill, and is one of my favorite aspects of RuneScape. What initially drew me into the skill was the sheer depth and complexity. Archaeology wasn't a skill about combat but required exploration, discovery, and historical immersion. One of the key reasons I enjoyed Archaeology was the multitude of dig sites introduced around Gielinor. Each dig site had its own unique lore, history, and set of artifacts to uncover. The mysteries and collection logs also added an extra layer of depth to the skill. These challenges encouraged me to explore further into the game's lore and piece together puzzles.

Once I reached level 108 Archaeology, I focused on Xolo City at the Orthen Dig Site on Anachronia. As there were no carts to deposit materials at the site, I made use of a pocket item called Sign of the porter VII. The item automatically deposited materials into the material storage container, which allowed for me to spend more time at the site. When I ran dry of porters, I would activate my premier artefact to act as a sign of the porter for an hour. It was an effective method that allowed me to focus on the acquirement of high level artifacts.

Though when I achieved level 120 Archaeology, I took a break from Xolo City to acquire every Archaeology item from the guild shop and to complete every Archaeology collection and mystery. This venture required a great deal of time and sometimes luck. Though a magic skill I used twice daily helped guarantee certain artifacts that I needed from various hot spots. Each time I completed a collection, I would receive chronotes that I could spend at the Archaeology Guild Shop. It took over a million chronotes to unlock every item and upgrade in the shop.

After I had completed my Archaeology achievement goals, I returned to Xolo City to finish off 200 million experience points. I amassed a large collection of damaged gold dishes and 'Raksha' idols. Around level 118 Archaeology, I started to fix these artifacts in mass batches, which resulted in experience rates far above two to three million per hour. It cost a lot of money to purchase the materials required to fix the artifacts but reduced the time commitment greatly. I finished off Archaeology outside of the Anachronia base camp by adding rex skeleton fragments to the Rex skeleton. My position on the HiScores for Archaeology is 13,708.

### 200M Thieving

With level 99 Thieving, the skill was technically finished. However, with the high experience per hour at the Rogues' Castle in the Wilderness, I thought Thieving would be an easy skill to level to virtual level 120. To increase the experience per hour even more, I wanted to have access to the additional hidden safes in Zemouregal's fort, along with the Glacor Cave teleportation. This, however, was easier said than done. There were a number of quests required to be completed first, all with individual requirements. I can remember thinking I was finished multiple times, only to discover another requirement. But overall, I would say the quests were worth doing since the experience rate per hour was around one million afterwards.

Around the time I achieved virtual level 120, the Wilderness Rework had been implemented into the game. The project effectively removed threats from the Wilderness, which meant I could crack safes at the Rogues' Castle without concern. I decided to push forward to 200 million experience points in Thieving, the maximum amount of points for any skill in the game. I wouldn't receive any reward for doing so but my position on the high scores would be permanent. It took a little longer than I had hoped, due to a Wilderness safe reset timer increase that randomly came with an update to the Wilderness. But overall, it was not a horrible endeavour. I ended up receiving the Thieving pet, Ralph, around 180 million experience. My position as of this writing is 9,239 for Thieving.

## Necromancy and the Future

Currently, I've been focused on Necromancy, a new combat skill released in August 2023. Players can now summon the undead and perform various rituals for a variety of rewards. As with any skill, Necromancy was slow to level early on. But, now that I'm near level 90, the experience rate per hour has gone up greatly. My only annoyance with the skill has been weapon and armor upgrades every ten levels. Upgrades require tasks to be completed first, such as particular boss kills along with a certain number of normal monster kills. Afterwards, materials for the upgrades must be generated through rituals, which is expensive at higher levels. Yet outside of the upgrades, I have enjoyed the combat aspect of the skill.

Along with the goal to reach level 99 Necromancy to re-obtain my max cape, I also want to reach 200 million Farming experience to finish off the skill within the next year. At the time of this writing, my Farming experience is around 160 million experience points. Although relatively close to my experience goal, I haven't been as active with Farming lately. I usually just have ten black dragons at the Player-Owned Farm, which is around 900,000 experience a week without any bonus experience.
