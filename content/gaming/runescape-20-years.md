In the fall of 2003, I saw RuneScape for first time at a friends house. His character was at the Black Knights' Fortress. That very night, I went home and made my first account.

## Rares and Lessons

I purchased my first rare item in late 2003, a Red hallowe'en mask. I wore it everywhere I went in the game, even to places considered dangerous. As a low level player at the time, I was unfamiliar with Karamja and the North Brimhaven mine. Upon arrival, I was attacked by poisonous scorpions. Far from a bank and without Antipoison, my character would soon die. The Red hallowe'en mask, along with my other possessions, would drop to the ground. In a panic, I logged off and made a phone call to the friend. I begged for help. Thankfully, he agreed. Upon login, my character died but my friend was ready to grab the mask and the other items from the ground.

It was around this time that the RuneScape 2 beta was released, a massive update to the game engine. 2D sprites, which RuneScape was known for, were replaced with 3D models. In this process, a number of items became unobtainable. One of these items was the war ship, an item once found in Glough's house in the Gnome Stronghold, during the Grand Tree quest. The only way to acquire it was by transferring it from your Classic account when RuneScape 2 first came out. Because of this, the war ship is now considered one of the rarest items in the game. And since I was hoarder at the time, I still have one in my bank.

Even with the release of RuneScape 2, quests and skills were ignored as I spent hundreds of hours in Falador Park. With wavy text commands, I would repeatedly advertise trade and sell offers, sometimes not sleeping. I can remember being at a friends house with a laptop, long after everyone went to bed, trading until the sun came up. I was focused on making enough gold to purchase a party hat. I cannot remember which color I purchased first, though I have printed screenshots of yellow and green party hats. My enjoyment of these items, however, would not last.

In the summer of 2005, prior to the release of the bank pin system, my account was compromised. I logged in at Castle Wars, only to find my character to be wearing a quest item, a gold helmet from a quest called Between a Rock. I immediately checked my bank, only to find that all of my rare items, including gold, were gone. I had spent the better part of two years trading to acquire that wealth and bad password security was an easy downfall. On a yellow school folder where I kept printed screenshots of RuneScape, I wrote, "Retired". I even taped a screenshot onto the folder of my character holding a Fixed Device, from Mourning's End Part I, with the caption, "End of RuneScape". I decided to quit the game.

That lasted a few days. I changed my password, logged back on, and found a Black Cavalier in my bank. By no means an expensive item at the time, the Black Cavalier was still worth a sizeable amount of gold in 2005. Since it was a fairly new item, I assume that the person who had compromised my account did not know what it was. I sold the item and re-bought all of my rune armor and dragon weapons that had been taken. That allowed for me to get back into quests and PVM content. Though my playtime per week dropped drastically for nearly four years.

## First 99

In early summer of 2009, Woodcutting brought me back to the RuneScape. The skill was relaxing and required minimal input. The magic trees at the Sorcerer's Tower near Seer's Village was a favored spot. The tower had it's own social community. It was a great place to kill time and chat with other players. The anti-macro or random events provided comedic relief. One of my favorites was the Strange Plant. If a player failed to pick the fruit once it was fully grown, the plant would attack the player. It was common for many players to be away for the keyboard for too long and die. The Ent event, however, could be an annoyance. If your axe head broke off, you had to fetch it and travel to Bob's Axe shop in Lumbridge to fix it.

Level 99 Woodcutting, the maximum level of the skill, became a reality in September of that year. Although I enjoyed the Sorcerer's Tower, a faster Woodcutting method had been released into the game, Ivy. I received no money in return but the experience per hour went up greatly in comparison to cutting magic logs. There was less conversation to be had along the walls of Falador or Varrock Palace but by the end of fall, I achieved my first 99. The last few chunks of experience points were gained back at the Sorcerer's Tower. It was the first time I was able to purchase a skillcape, also known as a Cape of Accomplishment.

## Second 99

From the fall of 2010 until the summer of 2014, RuneScape was set aside. College was my primary focus, though I did return for the yearly Halloween and Christmas events. Deathcon II, the 2011 Halloween event, was a favorite. Players were required to aid Death in preparing the Grim Reaper's Citadel for a convention. One of the rewards for the event was a Deathcon t-shirt, which I've worn each Halloween since.

## Road to Max

## First 120

Player-owned farm, in my opinion, was one of the greatest additions to RuneScape. It's an activity that brought the Farming skill back to life.

## 200M Archaeology

## 200M Thieving

When it came time to tackle 99 Thieving, I was surprised to learn about safe cracking. The experience rate per hour, even with basic safes, was incredible. At level 90, I spent most nights at the Rogues' Castle in the Wilderness. With active safe cracking, the experience rate was above 500,000 experience per hour without bonus experience or double experience. Player killing in the Wilderness was uncommon at the time but I did have to hop worlds every now and then.

Once level 99 was achieved, the skill was technically finished. I had nothing else to unlock. However, with the experience rates in mind, I thought Thieving would be an easy skill to level to virtual level 120. To speed up the process, I wanted to have access to the additional hidden safes in Zemouregal's fort, along with the Glacor Cave teleportation. This, however, was easier said than done. There are a number of quests required to be completed first, all with individual requirements. I can remember thinking I was finished multiple times, only to discover another requirement. But overall, I would say the quests were worth doing since the experience rate per hour was around one million afterwards.

Around the time I achieved virtual level 120, the Wilderness Rework had been implemented into the game. The project effectively removed threats from the Wilderness, which meant I could crack safes at the Rogues' Castle without concern. I decided to push forward to 200 million experience points in Thieving, the maximum amount of points for any skill in the game. I wouldn't receive any reward for doing so but my position on the high scores would be permanent. It took a little longer than I had hoped, due to a Wilderness safe reset timer increase that randomly came with an update to the Wilderness. But overall, it was not a horrible endeavour. I ended up receiving the Thieving pet, Ralph, around 180 million experience. My position as of this writing is 9,239 for Thieving.
